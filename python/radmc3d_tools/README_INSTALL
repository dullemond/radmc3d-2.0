To install the radmc3d_tools, you have to point the PYTHONPATH to this directory
(or one of its parent directories).

However, the standard installation by the RADMC-3D package is done slightly
differently:

  cd ../../

to bring you back to the root of the RADMC-3D package, then:

  cd src/
  make install

This should be it!

Explanation:

The src/install.perl script will copy the radmc3d_tools package to the following
directory in your $HOME:

  $HOME/bin/python/radmc3d_tools/

and it will make this directory if it is not yet there. Then you just need to
point your PYTHONPATH to $HOME/bin/python/ and you're done.  To do this in the
bash shell add the following line to your .bashrc file (which is a file that
should be located in your $HOME directory; if not, create it):

  export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/bin/python/:$PYTHONPATH

If you use (in the future) a different version of RADMC-3D, you do not need to
add each version of RADMC-3D to the PYTHONPATH. The latest "make install"
installation will automatically make that version current, by copying the
relevant stuff into the $HOME/bin/ directory.
