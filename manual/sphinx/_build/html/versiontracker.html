<span id="chap-development-history"></span><h1>Version tracker: Development history<a class="headerlink" href="#version-tracker-development-history" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This version overview is very rough, and has only been started as of version
0.25.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Version 0.25</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Second order integration, based on a vertex-based grid (as opposed to
the usual cell-based grid), implemented. This gives much smoother images,
and you don’t see the blocky cell structure anymore in the images. It
requires extra memory, though. See Section <a class="reference internal" href="imagesspectra.html#sec-second-order"><span class="std std-ref">Second order ray-tracing (Important information!)</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of photons for scattering Monte Carlo (i.e. the small MC
run done before each image, if dust scattering is active) can now be
chosen to be smaller for when you make a spectrum instead of an
image. Reason: Since you anyway integrate over the images for a
spectrum, you do not need the image to ‘look nice’, i.e. you can
afford more photon noise. You can set this in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d.inp</span></code> by
setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_spec=10000</span></code>, for instance. See Section
<a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#sec-scat-monte-carlo"><span class="std std-ref">Scattered light in images and spectra: The ‘Scattering Monte Carlo’ computation</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.26</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For line transfer: Added the ‘doppler catching’ method to the
code. This prevents bad numerical artifacts in images/spectra of regions
with large velocity gradients, where the doppler-shift between two
neighboring cells exceeds the intrinsic line width of the material in
the cell. See Section <a class="reference internal" href="lineradtrans.html#sec-doppler-catching"><span class="std std-ref">Preventing doppler jumps: The ‘doppler catching method’</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>NOTE: Up to, and including, version <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0.26_23.02.11</span></code> this
method (and for that matter any second order integration of line
transfer) was not stable when strong shocks or contact discontinuities
were encountered. This was because interpolation of the source function
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_\nu\equiv j_\nu/\alpha_\nu\)</span> was done. Experimentation showed that
interpolation of the emissivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_\nu\)</span> is much more stable. As of
version <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0.26_27.02.11</span></code> this is fixed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.27</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For line transfer: Implemented the possibility to use a Voigt line
profile instead of just a Gaussian. This was implemented by Thomas
Peters, and slightly modified by CPD. It uses the Voigt approximation by
Humlicek JQSRT 27, 437 (1982) as programmed by Schreier, JQSRT 48, 743
(1992). It requires a user-defined subroutine <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_compute_lorentz_delta()</span></code>
that sets the value of the Lorentz
profile delta. This implementation is not yet documented, and may still
be subject to modification.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented the ‘Large Velocity Gradient’ (LVG) method (also
called the Sobolev method) of approximate non-LTE line transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented the optically thin populations method.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented the possibility of reading linelist molecular data
instead of full molecular data. <em>Still needs testing.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Finally implemented the positive <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lines_mode</span></code> modes,
i.e. in which the level populations are computed and stored globally
before the ray-tracing. This has been latently in the code somewhat, but
unfinished. Now it is implemented. The advantage is: it may be under
some conditions much faster than the on-the-fly computation of the
populations during the ray-tracing (the negative <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lines_mode</span></code>
modes). Also it allows you to write the populations to file, so that you
can examine them. Disadvantage: It is memory hungry.</p></li>
<li><p>The level subset capacilities are now limited to only the storage of
the levels in the global arrays (for positive <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lines_mode</span></code> modes),
and to the lines that will appear in
images/spectra. For the rest, the full set of levels are always used
from now on.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a directory ‘<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opac/</span></code>‘ which contains programs
for generating your own dust opacities using optical constants from the
web, and for generating your own molecular/atomic input data files using
data from several web pages. The data from the web are not included, but
there are README files that point you to the web sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Tested the ‘fisheye’ fulldome (OMNIMAX) projection. It seems to
work! Thanks to Mario Flock.</p></li>
<li><p>Several small (and bigger) bugfixes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fixed bug that showed up when no dust is included.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug that caused RADMC-3D to crash when using no stars.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug that caused RADMC-3D to crash when making images at very
short wavelengths with nearly zero thermal emission.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug in the AMR module when using second order integration or
the doppler catching method with certain kinds of AMR-arrangements of
cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed many bugs when using a ‘piece of a cake’ model, i.e.
using spherical coordinates in 3-D, but having the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>-grid going
not over the full <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0-2\pi\)</span> range but e.g. just from 0 to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi/4\)</span>. It
is rather rare that one really wants to use such grids (certainly not
for real physical models, I presume), but for visualization of data it
might be useful: for instance for visualizing a 3-D disk MHD model,
which is cut open so you can see also to the midplane. Now it
works. Thanks to Mario Flock.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug with the aperture mode for spectra. Thanks to Daniel Harsono.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed many bugs in linelist mode; now it works. Thanks to Attila
Juhasz.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in LVG mode that caused it to fail when AMR was used.
Thanks to Anika Schmiedeke.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a tiny bug in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">idl/radmc3dfits.pro</span></code>: filename was
unused. Thanks to Stella Offner.</p></li>
<li><p>Retroactive bugfix from version 0.28 (see below): LVG and AMR mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For details and for smaller bugfixes, read the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/Radmc_3D_LOG.txt</span></code> document.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.28</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A number of people complained that even without AMR the code
requires a huge amount of memory. That is because even if no AMR is
used, the cells are connected via the AMR tree. Since the AMR cells
contain information about which are the neighboring cells, and each cell
has 6 neighbors, and slots for 8 child-cells (which are unused in case
of a regular grid) this wastes a lot of memory space. The first big
improvement in version 0.28 is that, from now on, the AMR tree is only
set up and used if the grid indeed has refinement. If RADMC-3D notices
that the grid is regular, it will not allocate space for the AMR tree,
and everywhere in the code where the cell-management is done the code
will switch to regular grid mode. There is now a flag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amr_tree_present</span></code>
that says whether the AMR tree is present or
not. Throughout the code there are now if-statements to switch between
using or not-using the AMR tree. This may make the code a tiny bit
slower, but this is only a minor reduction of speed. But as a result it
should now be much easier to load huge regular grid models into memory.</p></li>
<li><p>A small (but potentially nasty) bug was found and fixed for the case
when you use LVG mode on a grid with AMR-refinements. For the regular
grid case (even in version 0.27, when it still used the AMR tree) this
bug should not have caused problems, but perhaps you might want to check
nevertheless. Note: This bug is now also retroactively fixed in version
0.27. See, as always, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/Radmc_3D_LOG.txt</span></code> for details.</p></li>
<li><p>Added the possibility to visualize the location (along the line of
sight) of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau=1\)</span> surface (or any <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau=\tau_s\)</span> surface for that
matter). See new Section <a class="reference internal" href="imagesspectra.html#sec-tausurf"><span class="std std-ref">Visualizing the \tau=1 surface</span></a>. This can be very useful
for getting a 3-D feeling for <em>where</em> certain emission comes from.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.29</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The big change in this version is that the whole stuff with the
global storage of level populations has been improved. In earlier
versions of RADMC-3D, either the populations of <em>all</em> levels of a
molecule were stored globally (potentially requiring huge amounts of
memory), or you would have to select a ‘subset’ of levels to store
globally. This subset selection had to be done by the user
(‘manually’, so to speak). You would have had to think a-priori which
lines you wish to model, and which levels they connect, and then, in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lines.inp</span></code> file you would have to select these levels by
hand. That was cumbersome and prone to error. To avoid having to do this
you could use ‘on-the-fly’ calculation of populations (by making the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lines_mode</span></code> negative), but that sometimes caused the code to
become terribly slow. <em>Now this is dramatically improved:</em> From now
on you can forget about the ‘on-the-fly’ calculation of populations.
Just use the ‘normal’ way by which RADMC-3D first calculates the
populations and then starts the ray-tracing. The subset-selection is now
done automatically by RADMC-3D, based on which wavelengths you want to
make the image(s) or spectra for (see Section
<a class="reference internal" href="lineradtrans.html#sec-calcstore-levpop"><span class="std std-ref">Background information: Calculation and storage of level populations</span></a>). Now the on-the-fly methods are no longer
default and should not be used, unless absolutely necessary. Also the
‘manual’ subset selection is no longer necessary (though still
possible if absolutely desired).</p></li>
<li><p>Added the subbox and sample capabilities to the level populations.
See Sections <a class="reference internal" href="toolsinside.html#sec-subbox"><span class="std std-ref">Making a regularly-spaced datacube (‘subbox’) of AMR-based models</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="toolsinside.html#sec-sampling"><span class="std std-ref">Alternative to subbox: arbitrary sampling of AMR-based models</span></a>. Note that, in
order to make it easier to identify which levels were written to file,
the file formats of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">***_subbox.out</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">***_sample.out</span></code> have been
slightly modified: A list of identification
numbers is added before the main data. For the dust temperature and dust
density this list is simply 1 2 3 4 …  (dust species 1, dust species
2, dust species 3 …), which is trivial. For the level populations
(e.g. the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">levelpop_co_subbox.out</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">levelpop_co_sample.out</span></code>
for the CO molecule) this list is, however,
essential when not all levels were computed (see Section
<a class="reference internal" href="lineradtrans.html#sec-calcstore-levpop"><span class="std std-ref">Background information: Calculation and storage of level populations</span></a>). So if only level 4 and level 8 are stored,
then the identification list is 4 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug which caused the code to crash when you put a star
substantially far outside of the domain and try to make an image or
spectrum. Thanks, Erika Hamden, for the bug report.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that prevented the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lines_mode=50</span></code> mode from
working. Now it works, and we can ask RADMC-3D to read the level
populations from file (rather than calculating them internally).  Also a
new section was added to this manual describing this option (Section
<a class="reference internal" href="lineradtrans.html#sec-nonlte-read-levelpop"><span class="std std-ref">Non-LTE Transfer: Reading the level populations from file</span></a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Added VTK output options (see chapter <a class="reference internal" href="vtkoutput.html#chap-vtk-output"><span class="std std-ref">Visualization with VTK tools (e.g. Paraview or VisIt)</span></a>) for
allowing 3-D visualization of your model setups using e.g. Paraview, a
freely available visualization tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that occurred sometimes if a spectrum was made at
inclination 90 and phi 90. Thanks Stella Offner for reporting this bug.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.30</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fixed bugs in the Henyey-Greenstein scattering mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduced the new binary I/O feature: No more hassle with
f77-unformatted records! The new binary mode is much simpler and more
straightforward. This will help reducing the file sizes for large models.
See Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="binaryio.html#chap-binary-io"><span class="std std-ref">Binary I/O files</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.31</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added the possibility, in cartesian coordinates, to ‘close the
box’, in the sense of making the domain boundaries thermal walls.
Each of the 6 boundaries can be set separately, so you can also have
just one thermall wall. Also the temperatures can be set separately
for each of the 6 boundaries. See Section <a class="reference internal" href="gridding.html#sec-thermal-boundaries"><span class="std std-ref">Thermal boundaries in Cartesian coordinates</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added two new coordinate systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cartesian 1-D plane-parallel (the only remaining active coordinate
is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>). The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> dimensions are infinitely extended and
have translational symmetry. The photons can, however, travel in
full 3-D as always. See Section <a class="reference internal" href="gridding.html#sec-1d-plane-parallel"><span class="std std-ref">1-D Plane-parallel models</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cartesian 2-D pencil-parallel (the two remaining active coordinate
are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>). The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> dimension is infinitely extended and
has translational symmetry. The photons can, however, travel in
full 3-D as always.</p></li>
<li><p>For the 1-D plane-parallel mode it is possible to include parallel
beams of radiative flux impinging on the 1-D atmosphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Attila Juhasz has improved the VTK output: Now it also supports
3-D spherical coordinates. Thanks, Attila!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.32</em></p>
<p>This is an intermediate version in which some stuff for the near-future
modus of polarization is implemented.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.33</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some minor technical changes to the doppler-catching integration of
lines (storing the upper and lower level population instead of the
jnubase and anubase variables).</p></li>
<li><p>Added the classical escape probability to the LVG mode (see Section
<a class="reference internal" href="lineradtrans.html#sec-lvg"><span class="std std-ref">Non-LTE Transfer: The Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) + Escape Probability (EscProb) method</span></a> for details).</p></li>
<li><p>Sped up the filling of the matrix of the statistical equilibrium
equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Vastly improved the LVG (and esc prob) method: Instead of the simple
‘lambda iteration style’ iteration as it was before, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{ik}\)</span> is
now multiplied with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_{ik}\)</span> (the escape probability of the line
i-&gt;k) and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(J_{ik}\)</span> is replaced by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(J_{ik}^{\mathrm{background}}\)</span>. This means that the solution is almost
instant, requiring only 2 or 3 iterations.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.34</em></p>
<p>Implemented the Modified Random Walk method, based on Min, Dullemond,
Dominik, de Koter &amp; Hovenier (2009) A&amp;A 497, 155, and simplified by
Robitaille (2010) A&amp;A 520, 70. But beware: Still in the testing
phase! By default it is switched off.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.35</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Implemented polarized scattering off randomly oriented
particles. But beware: Still in the testing phase!</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the modified random walk method (thanks to Daniel
Harsono for spotting the problem and thanks to Attila Juhasz for
finding the fix!)</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed two bugs that made it impossible to use second order
integration with axially symmetric spherical coordinates and/or
a finite-size star (thanks to Rolf Kuiper for reporting the bug).</p></li>
<li><p>Added the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sloppy</span></code> command line option to spectrum and
image making in spherical coordinates. This was necessary because
RADMC-3D is always trying to make 100% sure that all cells are picked
up by the subpixels. In spherical coordinates these cells can be
extremely non-cubic (they can be extremely flat or needle-like), which
means that under some projections RADMC-3D feels obliged to do extreme
sub-pixeling, which can make image- and spectrum-making extremely slow.
By adding the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sloppy</span></code>  keyword on the command line, RADMC-3D
will limit it’s pubpixeling which could speed up the calculation very
much (but of course at your own risk!).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.38</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Implemented OpenMP parallellization of the thermal Monte Carlo (by
Adriana Pohl). Still beta-version.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in the mean intensity computation (mcmono) mode (thanks to Gwendoline Stephan).</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in the mean intensity computation (mcmono) mode (thanks to Seokho Lee).</p></li>
<li><p>Major bugfix in aperture mode (thanks to So ren Frimann).</p></li>
<li><p>Unformatted image format is from now on C-style binary instead of
F77-style unformatted.</p></li>
<li><p>The viewimage tool is now ported to Qt by Farzin Sereshti, meaning
that you can now use viewimage without having an IDL license. Viewimage
is a very powerful tool to interactively make and view images of your
model at different wavelengths and viewing angles. It can be found
in the directory <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viewimage_QT_GUI/</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A Python package for RADMC-3D was developed by Attila Juhasz. It is
included as of RADMC-3D version 0.38 in the directory <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python/</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.39</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Polarization mode is incompatible with mirror mode (in spherical
coordinates). An error message is now included to catch this.</p></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfix in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pick_randomfreq_db()</span></code> (thanks to Seokho Lee).</p></li>
<li><p>Optimization of the OpenMP parallellization and extension of the
OpenMP parallellization to the Scattering Monte Carlo computation (both
by Farzin Sereshti).</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amrray_module.f90</span></code>: Sometimes one got ‘Photon
outside of cell’ error due to a numerical precision round-off
error. This bug is now (mostly?) fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sources_module.f90</span></code>: When using second order
integration (or doppler catching) for line transfer in spherical
coordinates, the line doppler shift was not transformed to spherical
coordinates. This is now fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Several bugfixes in the modified random walk method by
John Ramsey. The method crashed for extreme optical depth problems
due to out-of-cell events. Still not 100% perfect, but better.</p></li>
<li><p>John Ramsey also proposed two small fixes to the Planck function
routines so that the events of overflow are caught. Note: This might
change the results (in a tiny way: at the machine precision level) to
the extent that a model run by an old version might not yield the same
values to machine precision, but the differences should not matter in
any meaningful way.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.40</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The RADMC-3D package is now ‘officially’ converting from IDL to
Python wrappers. The Python modules were already there since a long time
(thanks to Attila Juhasz!). But as of version 0.40 we will no longer
update/maintain the IDL scripts (though they remain there and should
remain working), and instead use python as the main setup and analysis
tools for RADMC-3D. The full conversion will still take some time, but
should be finished by the end of version 0.40.</p></li>
<li><p>Under some circumstances the simple 2x2 pixel plus sub-pixeling
method for making spectra (default method) can be dangerous. For some
grid geometries this can lead to under-resolving of the images that are
integrated to obtain the flux, leading to a too low flux.  So as of now
15.09.2016 the spectra and SEDs are always by default made with 100x100
images (and sub-pixeling of course). One can set the number of pixels
with npix. So if you do <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3dsednostarnpix2</span></code> you get
the original behavior again.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">montecarlo_module.f90</span></code>:
The internal heat source method (which is still being tested)
had a bug. The bug manifested itself for optically thin cells with
non-negligible internal heat production. The energy was not immediately
added to the cell. It only got added upon re-absorption of that photon
package. Now this is fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>I now added some documentation for the heat source method, which
is useful for e.g. disk viscous accretion heating.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">montecarlo_module.f90</span></code>: When using mirror
symmetry in spherical coordinates in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>-coordinate
(i.e. modeling only the upper part of the disk and letting RADMC-3D
assume that the lower part is identical), the distributed source
luminosity was computed only for the top quadrant, and wasn’t multiplied
by 2. For most applications this does not cause problems, but for the
heat source (see above), for continuous stellar sources and for the
thermal origin of the isotropic scattering luminosity (for non-isotropic
scattering, mirror symmetry was not allowed anyway), this could lead to
a factor of 2 underestimation (only if mirror symmetry was used, i.e.
if the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> coordinate was going only up to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi/2\)</span>). This is now
fixed. To test if the fix works one can simply make the same model
again, but now without using mirror symmetry (and thus using twice as
many cells in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, to cover both the upper and lower half of the
object). This should yield (apart from some Monte Carlo noise) the same
results.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved the stability of the Modified Random Walk (MRW) method
a bit further.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: scattering mode 3 (tabulated phase function, but not full
polarization) had a bug which caused images of scattered light to be
multiplied by some arbitrary number. Reason: as a phase function it
returned <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z_{11}\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\pi Z_{11}/\kappa_{\mathrm{scat}}\)</span>. Most
people use either isotropic scattering (scattering mode 1), or
Henyey-Greenstein (scattering mode 2) or full polarization (scattering
mode 5), all of which are ok. At any rate: the problem is now fixed,
so scattering mode 3 should now also work.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 0.41</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Implemented a first testing version of the aligned grains:
only polarized thermal emission so far. Still very much a testing
version.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented a method to also allow full Stokes vector polarized
scattering in the 2-D axisymmetric mode in spherical
coordinates. Until now the full scattering mode (scattering mode 5)
was only possible in full 3-D. Note however that anisotropic
scattering in 2-D axisymmetric models requires scattering mode 5,
which is the full scattering mode.  It is still not possible to use
intermediate scattering modes (like henyey-greenstein or any
scattering mode between 2 and 4) in 2-D axisymmetry. But those
intermediate modes are anyway more for testing than for real models,
so that should be ok.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfixes to the OpenMP stuff. In particular the OpenMP
parallellization of the scattering MC crashed. This is now fixed.
In general the OpenMP stuff was a bit cleaned up.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in thermal Monte Carlo with full polarization mode: needed
to reset the photon package after each thermal absorption/re-emission
event. Usually the effect is subtle, but had to be fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in reading the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scattering_angular_grid.inp</span></code>:
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">theta</span></code> angles should be converted into radian. But
this file was not officially offered before anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Attila Juhasz has made a large improvement of his python package
for RADMC-3D. See the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python/</span></code> directory. This is version
0.29 of his package. This package now also supports reading and
writing AMR grids.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugfix in VTK for 3-D spherical coordinates (thanks Attila Juhasz!).
Now it should work.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Version 2.0</em></p>
<p>Version 2.0 is the version after 0.41. We skip version 1.0, because
version 1.0 could be mistaken for the first version of the code. Version
2.0 is mostly the same as 0.41, but with a few differences.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>IDL support is removed permanently. From now on, the front-end
functionality is only in Python. We assume Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Version 0.30.2 of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3dPy</span></code> Python package (written by
Attila Juhasz) has been implemented. It is also being improved, mainly to
make its use easier (i.e. with more automatic default behavior).</p></li>
<li><p>A very simple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simpleread.py</span></code> reading library is provided
as a ‘light version’ of radmc3dPy. It contains only some basic reading
functions, and only for ascii output (no binary files).</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the standard-output is shortened. You can also call a
Monte Carlo run with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> with the command line
options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">countwrite</span> <span class="pre">100000</span></code> to make RADMC-3D write a
message only every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^5\)</span> photon packages instead of every thousand.</p></li>
<li><p>We removed the fortran-unformatted data format from the manual,
and will remove it from the code in later versions. Use either text
(ascii) format or binary format.</p></li>
<li><p>The manual is now converted to Sphinx, from which the LaTeX version
and the HTML version can be automatically created.</p></li>
<li><p>[as of 11.11.2021] BUGFIX: For OpenMP parallel thermal Monte Carlo
computation of the dust temperatures for multiple grain species or
sizes, when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iranfreqmode=1</span></code> (as opposed to the default value of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iranfreqmode=0</span></code>), the dust temperatures could acquire errors
because the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pick_randomfreq_db()</span></code> subroutine uses the array
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">db_cumul(:)</span></code> as thread private, but without having it declared
as such. This led to interference between threads. This is now
fixed.</p></li>
