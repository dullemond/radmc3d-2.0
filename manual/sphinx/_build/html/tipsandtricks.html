<h2>Tips and tricks<a class="headerlink" href="#tips-and-tricks" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>RADMC-3D is a large software package, and the user will in all
likelihood not understand all its internal workings. In this section we will
discuss some issues that might be useful to know when you do modeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Things that can drastically slow down ray-tracing:</em></p>
<p>When you create images or spectra, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> will perform a ray-tracing
calculation. You may notice that sometimes this can be very fast, but for
other problems it can be very slow. This is because, depending on which
physics is switched on, different ray-tracing strategies must be followed. For
instance, if you use a dust opacity without scattering opacity (or if you
switch dust scattering off by setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scattering_mode_max</span></code> to 0 in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d.inp</span></code> file), and you make dust continuum images, or make SEDs, this
may go very rapidly: less than a minute on a modern computer for grids of
256x256x256. However, when you include scattering, it may go slower. Why is
that? That is because at each wavelength <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> will now have to make a
quick Monte Carlo scattering model to compute the dust scattering source
function. This costs time. And it will cost more time if you have
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_scat</span></code> set to a high value in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d.inp</span></code> file, although it
will create better images. Furthermore, if you <em>also</em> include gas lines using
the simple LTE or simple LVG methods, then things become even slower, because
each wavelength channel image is done after each other, and each time all the
populations of the molecular levels have to be re-computed. If dust scattering
would be switched off (which is for some wavelength domains presumably not a
bad approximation; in particular for the millimeter domain), then no
scattering Monte Carlo runs have to be done for each wavelength. Then the code
can ray-trace all wavelength simultaneously: each ray is traced only once, for
all wavelength simultaneously. Then the LTE/LVG level populations have to be
computed only once at each location along the ray.  So if you use dust and
lines simultaneously, it can be advantageous for speed if you can afford to
switch off the dust scattering, for instance, if you model sub-millimeter
lines in regions with dust grains smaller than 10 micron or so. If you must
include scattering, but your model is not so big that you may get memory
limitation problems, then you may also try the fast LTE or fast LVG modes: in
those modes the level populations are pre-computed before the ray-tracing
starts, which saves time. But that may require much memory.</p>

</ul>

<section id="bug-hunting">
<h2>Bug hunting<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-hunting" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Although we of course hope that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> will not run into
troubles or crash, it is nevertheless possible that it will. There are
several ways by which one can hunt for bugs, and we list here a few
obvious ones:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In principle the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> should make sure that all dependencies of all
modules are correct, so that the most dependent modules are compiled last. But
during the further development of the code perhaps this may be not 100%
guaranteed. So try do <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makeclean</span></code> followed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makeinstall</span></code>) to assure a clean make.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> you can add (or uncomment) the line
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BCHECK=-fbounds-check</span></code>, if you use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gfortran</span></code>.  Find the array
boundary check switch on your own compiler if it is not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gfortran</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main.f90</span></code> code the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">debug_check_all</span></code> is
set to 1. This will do some on-the-fly checks in the code.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="some-tips-for-avoiding-troubles-and-for-making-good-models">
<h2>Some tips for avoiding troubles and for making good models<a class="headerlink" href="#some-tips-for-avoiding-troubles-and-for-making-good-models" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Here is a set of tips that we recommend you to follow, in order to avoid
troubles with the code and to make sure that the models you make are OK.
This list is far from complete! It will be updated as we continue to
develop the code.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Make a separate directory for each model. This avoids confusion with
the many input and output files from the models.</p></li>
<li><p>When experimenting: regularly keep models that work, and continue
experimenting with a fresh model directory. If things go wrong later, you
can always fall back on an older model that <em>did</em> work well.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep model directories within a parent directory of the code, just
like it is currently organized. This ensures that each model is always
associated to the version of the code for which it was developed.  If you
update to a new version of the code, it is recommended to simply copy the
models you want to continue with to the new code directory (and edit the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SRC</span></code> variable in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> if you use the
techniques described in Section <a class="reference internal" href="installation.html#sec-special-purpose-compile"><span class="std std-ref">Making special-purpose modified versions of RADMC-3D (optional)</span></a> and
Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="internalsetup.html#chap-internal-setup"><span class="std std-ref">Modifying RADMC-3D: Internal setup and user-specified radiative processes</span></a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If you make a new model, try to start with as clean a directory as
possible. This avoids that you accidently have a old files hanging around,
their presence of which may cause troubles in your new model.  So if you
make a model update, make a new directory and then copy only the files
that are necesary (for instance, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">problem_setup.py</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dustkappa_silicate.inp</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> and other
necessary files). One way of doing this easily is to write a little perl
script or csh script that does this for you.</p></li>
<li><p>In the example model directories there is always a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>
present, even if no local <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*.f90</span></code> files are present. The idea
is that by typing {small make cleanall} you can safely clean up the
model directory and restore it to pre-model status. This can be useful
for safely cleaning model directories so that only the model setup files
remain there. It may save enormous amounts of disk space. But of course,
it means that if you revisit the model later, you would need to redo
the Monte Carlo simulations again, for instance. It is a matter of
choice between speed of access to results on the one hand and disk space
on the other hand.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use LVG or escape probability to compute the level populations
of molecules, please be aware that you must include all levels that could
be populated, not only the levels belonging to the line you are interested
in.</p></li>

<span id="sec-things-going-wrong"></span><h2>Careful: Things that might go wrong<a class="headerlink" href="#careful-things-that-might-go-wrong" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In principle RADMC-3D should be fine-tuned such that it produced reliable
results in most circumstances. But radiative transfer modeling, like all
kinds of modeling, is not an entirely trivial issue. Extreme circumstances
can lead to wrong results, if the user is not careful in doing various
sanity checks. This section gives some tips that you, the user, may wish
to do to check that the results are ok. This is not an exhaustive list!
So please remain creative yourself in coming up with good tests and checks.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><em>Too low number of photon packages for thermal Monte Carlo</em></p>
<p>If the number of photon packages for the thermal Monte Carlo simulation
(Section <a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo"><span class="std std-ref">The thermal Monte Carlo simulation: computing the dust temperature</span></a>) is too low, the dust
temperatures are going to be very noisy. Some cells may even have temperature
zero. This may not only lead to noisy images and spectra, but also simply
wrong results. However, deep inside optically thick clouds (or protoplanetary
disks) it will be hard to avoid this problem.  Since those regions are very
deep below the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau=1\)</span> surface, it might not be always too critical in
that case. A bit of experimenting might be necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Too low number of photon packages for scattering</em></p>
<p>When making images or spectra in which dust scattering is important, the
scattered light emissivity is computed by a quick Monte Carlo simulation
before the ray-tracing (see Section <a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#sec-scat-monte-carlo"><span class="std std-ref">Scattered light in images and spectra: The ‘Scattering Monte Carlo’ computation</span></a>). This
requires the setting of the number of photon packages used for this (the
variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_scat</span></code> for images and equivalently <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_spec</span></code> for
spectra, both can be set in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d.inp</span></code> file). If you see too much
‘noise’ in your scattering image, you can improve this by setting
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_scat</span></code> to a larger value (default = 100000). If your spectrum
contains too much noise, try setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_spec</span></code> to a larger value
(default = 10000).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Too optically thick cells at the surface or inner edge</em></p>
<p>You may want to experiment with grid resolution and refinement. Strictly
speaking the transition from optically thin to optically thick, as seen both
by the radiation entering the object and by the observer, has to occur over
more than one cell. That is for very optically thick models, one may need to
introduce grid refinement in various regions. As an example: an optically
thick protoplanetary disk may have an extremely sharp thin-thick transition
near the inner edge. To get the spectra and images right, it is important
that these regions are resolved by the grid (note: once well inside the
optically thick interior, it is no longer necessary to resolve individual
optical mean free paths, thankfully). It should be said that in practice it
is often impossible to do this in full strictness. But you may want to at
least experiment a bit with refining the grid (using either ‘separable
refinement’, see Section <a class="reference internal" href="gridding.html#sec-separable-refinement"><span class="std std-ref">Separable grid refinement in spherical coordinates (important!)</span></a>, or AMR refinement,
see Section <a class="reference internal" href="inputoutputfiles.html#sec-amr-grid-oct-tree"><span class="std std-ref">Oct-tree-style AMR grid</span></a>). An example how wrong things can go
at the inner edge of a protoplanetary disk, if the inner cells are not
assured to be optically thin through grid refinement (and possibly
additionally a bit of smoothing of the density profile too) is given in
Fig. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-innerrim-lowres"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 30</span></a>.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id1">

<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 30 </span><span class="caption-text">Example of what can go wrong with radiative transfer if the inner cells of
a model are optically thick (i.e.if no grid refinement is used, see

inner cells are marginally optically thin <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\simeq 1\)</span>,
creating a bright inner ring, as is expected. Right image: ten times
higher optical depth, making the inner cells optically thick with roughly
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\simeq 10\)</span>, resulting in a wrong image in which the
emission near the midplane is strongly reduced.  The reason for that is
that the scattering source function, due to photons scattering at the
inner 10% of the inner cell, is diluted over the entire cell, making the
scattered light brighness 10x lower than it should be.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li><p><em>Model does not fit onto the grid (or onto the refined part of the grid)</em></p>
<p>The grid must be large enough to contain the entire <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_\lambda=1\)</span>
surface of a model at all relevant wavelengths. If you use grid refinement,
the same is true for the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_\lambda=1\)</span> surface being within the
refinened part of the grid. This is not trivial!  If you, for instance,
import a 3-D hydrodynamic model into RADMC-3D, then it is a common problem
that the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_\lambda=1\)</span> surface ‘wants’ to be outside of the grid (or
outside of the higher-resolution part of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>-grid if you use
separable grid refinement: see Fig. <span class="xref std std-ref">fig-spher-sep-ref</span>). For example:
if you make a * hydrodynamic* model of a protoplanetary disk in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Theta\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Phi\)</span> coordinates, you typically want to model only
the lower 2 pressure scale heights of the disk, since that contains 99.5% of
the mass of the disk. However, for <em>radiative transfer</em> this may not be
enough, since if the disk has an optical depth of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau=10^3\)</span>, the
optically thin surface layer is less than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.1\%\)</span> of the disk mass,
meaning that you need to model the lower 3 (not 2!) pressure scale
heights. Simply inserting the hydrodynamics model with the first 2 scale
heights would lead to an artifical cut-off of the disk. In other words, the
real <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_\lambda=1\)</span> surface ‘wants’ to be outside of the grid (or
outside of the refined part of the grid). This leads to wrong results.</p>

<h2>Common technical problems and how to fix them<a class="headerlink" href="#common-technical-problems-and-how-to-fix-them" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When using a complex code such as RADMC-3D there are many ways you might
encounter a problem. Here is a list of common issues and tips how to fix them.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><em>After updating RADMC-3D to a new version, some setups don’t work anymore.</em></p>
<p>This problem can be due to several things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When your model makes a local <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> executable (see Section
<a class="reference internal" href="installation.html#sec-special-purpose-compile"><span class="std std-ref">Making special-purpose modified versions of RADMC-3D (optional)</span></a>), for instance when you use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_module.f90</span></code> to set up the model, then you may need to edit the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SRC</span></code> variable in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> again to point to the new code
directory, and type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makeclean</span></code> followed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you sure to have recompiled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> again <em>and</em> installed it (by
going in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/</span></code> and typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makeinstall</span></code>)?</p></li>
<li><p>Try going back to the old version and recheck that the model works well
there. If that works, and the above tricks don’t fix the problem, then it
may be a bug. Please contact the author.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>After updating RADMC-3D to a new version: the new features are not present/working.</em></p>
<p>Maybe again the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> issue above.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>After updating RADMC-3D to a new version: model based on userdef_module fails to compile</em></p>
<p>If you switch to a new version of the code and try to ‘make’ an earlier model
that uses the userdef_module.f90, it might sometimes happen that the
compilation fails because some subroutine <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_***</span></code> is not known (here
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">***</span></code> is some name). Presumably what happened is that a new user-defined
functionality has been added to the code, and the corresponding subroutine
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_***</span></code> has been added to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_module.f90</span></code>. If, however,
in your own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_module.f90</span></code> this subroutine is not yet built in, then
the compiler can’t find this subroutine and complains. Solution: just add a
dummy subroutine to your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_module.f90</span></code> with that name (have a look
at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userdef_module.f90</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/</span></code> directory).  Then recompile and
it should now work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>While reading an input file, RADMC-3D says ‘Fortran runtime error: End of file’</em></p>
<p>This can of course have many reasons. Some common mistakes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amr_grid.inp</span></code> you may have specified the coordinates of the nx*ny*nz
grid centers instead of (nx+1)*(ny+1)*(nz+1) grid cell interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>You may have no line feed at the end of one of the ascii input files.  Some
fortran compilers can read only lines that are officially ended with a
return or line feed. Solution: Just write an empty line at the end of such
a file.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>My changes to the main code do not take effect</em></p>
<p>Did you type, in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/</span></code> directory, the full <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makeinstall</span></code>? If you
type just <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code>, then the code is compiled but not installed as the
default code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>My userdef_module.f90 stuff does not work</em></p>
<p>If you run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> with own userdefined stuff, then you must make sure to
run the right executable. Just typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d</span></code> in the shell might cause
you to run the standard compilation instead of your special-purpose one. Try
typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./radmc3d</span></code> instead, which forces the shell to use the local
executable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>When I make images from the command line, they take very long</em></p>
<p>If you make images with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3dimage</span></code> (plus some keywords) from the
command line, the default is that a flux-conserving method of ray-tracing is
used, which is called recursive sub-pixeling (see Section
<a class="reference internal" href="imagesspectra.html#sec-image-refinement"><span class="std std-ref">The issue of flux conservation: recursive sub-pixeling</span></a>). You can make an image without sub-pixeling with
the command-line option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nofluxcons</span></code>. That goes much faster, and also
gives nice images, but the flux (the integral over the entire image) may
not be accurate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>My line channel maps (images) look bad</em></p>
<p>If you have a model with non-zero gas velocities, and if these gas velocities
have cell-to-cell differences that are larger than or equal to the intrinsic
(thermal+microturbulent) line width, then the ray-tracing will not be able to
pick up signals from intermediate velocities. In other words, because of the
discrete gridding of the model, only discrete velocities are present, which
can cause numerical problems. There are two possible solutions to this
problem. One is the wavelength band method described in Section
<a class="reference internal" href="imagesspectra.html#sec-wavelength-bands"><span class="std std-ref">Heads-up: In reality wavelength are actually wavelength bands</span></a>.  But a more systematic method is the ‘doppler
catching’ method described in Section <a class="reference internal" href="lineradtrans.html#sec-doppler-catching"><span class="std std-ref">Preventing doppler jumps: The ‘doppler catching method’</span></a> (which can
be combined with the wavelength band method of Section
<a class="reference internal" href="imagesspectra.html#sec-wavelength-bands"><span class="std std-ref">Heads-up: In reality wavelength are actually wavelength bands</span></a> to make it even more perfect).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>My line spectra look somewhat noisy</em></p>
<p>If you include dust continuum scattering (Section <a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#sec-scattering"><span class="std std-ref">More about scattering of photons off dust grains</span></a>) then
the ray-tracer will perform a scattering Monte Carlo simulation at each
wavelength. If you look at lines where dust scattering is still a strong
source of emission, and if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_scat</span></code> (Section
<a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#sec-scat-monte-carlo"><span class="std std-ref">Scattered light in images and spectra: The ‘Scattering Monte Carlo’ computation</span></a>) is set to a low value, then the different random
walks of the photon packages in each wavelength channel may cause slightly
different resulting fluxes, hence the noise.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>My dust continuum images look very noisy/streaky: many ‘lines’ in the image</em></p>
<p>There are two possible reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><em>Photon noise in the thermal Monte Carlo run:</em> If you have too few photon
packages for the thermal Monte Carlo computation (see Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#chap-dust-transfer"><span class="std std-ref">Dust continuum radiative transfer</span></a>), then the dust temperatures are simply not well
computed. This may give these effects. You must then increase <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot</span></code> in
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d.inp</span></code> file to increase the photon statistics for the thermal
Monte Carlo run.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Photon noise in the scattering Monte Carlo run:</em> If you are making an
image at a wavelength at which the disk is not emitting much thermal
radiation, then what you will see in the image is scattered light.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RADMC-3D</span></code> makes a special Monte Carlo run for scattered light before
each image. This Monte Carlo run has its own variable for setting the
number of photon packages: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_scat</span></code>. If this value is set too low,
then you can see individual ‘photon’-trajectories in the image, making the
image look bad. It is important to note that this can only be remedied by
increasing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot_scat</span></code> (in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radmc3d.inp</span></code> file, see Section
<a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#sec-scat-monte-carlo"><span class="std std-ref">Scattered light in images and spectra: The ‘Scattering Monte Carlo’ computation</span></a>), not by setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nphot</span></code> (which is the
number of photon packages for the thermal Monte Carlo computation). Please
also read Section <a class="reference internal" href="dustradtrans.html#sec-single-multiple-scattering"><span class="std std-ref">Single-scattering vs. multiple-scattering</span></a> for a detailed
discussion about the effects of multiple scattering and the possibility of
it leading to streaks in the images.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, it might also mean that something is wrong with the setup. A few
common setup-errors that could cause these issues are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Accidently created a way too massive object. Let us discuss this with an
example of a protoplanetary disk: suppose you created, in spherical
coordinates, not a protoplanetary disk with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{\mathrm{disk}}=0.01\,M_{\odot}\)</span> but accidently one with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{\mathrm{disk}}=10\,M_{\odot}\)</span>. In such a case a lot of things
will go wrong. First of all the inner edge of the disk will almost
certainly behave strangely (see Fig. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-innerrim-lowres"><span class="std std-ref">Example of what can go wrong with radiative transfer if the inner cells of
a model are optically thick (i.e.if no grid refinement is used, see
Section sec-separable-refinement). Shown here are scattered light
images at \lambda=0.7\muDelta R/R=0.04`.  Left image: the
inner cells are marginally optically thin \Delta\tau\simeq 1,
creating a bright inner ring, as is expected. Right image: ten times
higher optical depth, making the inner cells optically thick with roughly
\Delta\tau\simeq 10, resulting in a wrong image in which the
emission near the midplane is strongly reduced.  The reason for that is
that the scattering source function, due to photons scattering at the
inner 10% of the inner cell, is diluted over the entire cell, making the
scattered light brighness 10x lower than it should be.</span></a>). Secondly,
the surface of the disk will almost certainly be cut-off in the way
decribed in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-things-going-wrong"><span class="std std-ref">Careful: Things that might go wrong</span></a>, in which case the
surface of the disk will be hardly illuminated by the star, because the
disk surface is then exactly conical (i.e.starlight will not be able to
impinge on the surface). This will lead to very low photon statistics at
the surface.</p></li>
