Dust continuum radiative transfer
*********************************

Many of the things related to dust continuum radiative transfer have
already been said in the previous chapters. But here we combine these
things, and expand with more in-depth information.

Most users simply want RADMC-3D to compute images and spectra from a
model. This is done in a two-stage procedure:

#. First compute the dust temperature everywhere using the thermal Monte
   Carlo computation (Section :ref:`sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo`).
#. Then making the images and/or spectra (Section :ref:`sec-dust-ray-tracing`).

You can then view the output spectra and images with the Python tools or use
your own plotting software.

Some expert users may wish to use RADMC-3D for something entirely different:
to compute the local radiation field {\em inside} a model, and use this
for e.g. computing photochemistry rates of a chemical model or so. 
This is described in Section :ref:`sec-dust-monochromatic-monte-carlo`.

You may also use the thermal Monte Carlo computation of the dust temperature
to help estimating the {\em gas} temperature for the line radiative transfer.
See Chapter :ref:`chap-line-transfer` for more on line transfer.


.. _sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo:

The thermal Monte Carlo simulation: computing the dust temperature
==================================================================

RADMC-3D can compute the dust temperature using the Monte Carlo method of
Bjorkman & Wood (2001, ApJ 554, 615) with various improvements such as the
continuous absorption method of Lucy (1999, A&A 344, 282). Once a model is
entirely set up, you can ask ``radmc3d`` to do the Monte Carlo
run for you by typing in a shell::

  radmc3d mctherm

if you use the standard ``radmc3d`` code, or ::

  ./radmc3d mctherm

if you have created a local version of ``radmc3d`` (see Section
:ref:`sec-special-purpose-compile`).

What the method does is the following: First all the netto sources of energy
(or more accurately: sources of luminosity) are identified. The following
net sources of energy can be included:

* *Stars:* You can specify any number of individual stars: their
  position, and their spectrum and luminosity (See Section
  :ref:`sec-stars`). This is the most commonly used source of luminosity, and
  as a beginning user we recommend to use only this for now.
* *Continuum stellar source:* For simulations of galaxies it would
  require by far too many individual stars to properly include the input
  of stellar light from the billions of stars in the galaxy. To overcome
  this problem you can specify a continuously spatially distributed source
  of stars. *NOTE: Still in testing phase.*
* *Viscous heating / internal heating:* Sometimes the dust grains
  acquire energy directly from the gas, for instance through viscous heating
  of the gas or adiabatic compression of the gas. This can be included as a
  spatially distributed source of energy. *NOTE: Still in
  progress... Not yet working.*

To compute the dust temperature we must have at least one source of luminosity,
otherwise the equilibrium dust temperature would be everywhere 0.

The next step is that this total luminosity is divided into ``nphot`` packages,
where ``nphot`` is 100000 by default, but can be set to any value by the user
(see the file ``radmc3d.inp`` described in Section :ref:`sec-radmc-inp`). Then
these photon packages are emitted by these sources one-by-one. As they move
through the grid they may scatter off dust grains and thus change their
direction. They may also get absorbed by the dust. If that happens, the photon
package is immediately re-emitted in another direction and with another
wavelength. The wavelength is chosen according to the recipe by Bjorkman & Wood
(2001, ApJ 554, 615). The luminosity fraction that each photon package
represents remains, however, the same. Each time a photon package enters a cell
it increases the 'energy' of this cell and thus increases the temperature of
the dust of this cell.  The recipe for this is again described by Bjorkman &
Wood (2001, ApJ 554, 615), but contrary to that paper we increase the
temperature of the dust always when a photon package enters a cell, while
Bjorkman & Wood only increase the dust temperature if a discrete absorption
event has taken place. Each photon package will ping-pong through the model and
never gets lost until it escapes the model through the outer edge of the grid
(which, for cartesianl coordinates, is any of the grid edges in :math:`x`,
:math:`y` or :math:`z`, and for spherical coordinates is the outer edge of
:math:`r`). Once it escapes, a new photon package is launched, until also it
escapes. After all photon packages have been launched and escaped, the dust
temperature that remains is the final answer of the dust temperature.

One must keep in mind that the temperature thus computed is an *equilibrium*
dust temperature. It assumes that each dust grain acquires as much energy as it
radiates away. This is for most cases presumably a very good approximation,
because the heating/cooling time scales for dust grains are typically very short
compared to any time-dependent dynamics of the system. But there might be
situations where this may not be true: in case of rapid compression of gas, near
shock waves or in extremely optically thick regions.

*NOTE:* Monte Carlo simulations are based on pseudo-random numbers.
The seed for the random number generator is by default set to -17933201.
If you want to perform multiple identical simulations with a different
random sequence you will need to set the seed by hand. This can be
done by adding a line ::

  iseed = -5415

(where -5415 is to be replaced by the value you want) to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file.


.. _sec-modrandwalk:

Modified Random Walk method for high optical depths
---------------------------------------------------

As you will soon find out: very optically thick models make the RADMC-3D thermal
Monte Carlo simulations to be slow. This is because in the thermal Monte Carlo
method a photon package is never destroyed unless it leaves the system. A photon
package can thus 'get lost' deep inside an optically thick region, making
millions (or even billions) of absorption+reemission or scattering
events. Furthermore, you will notice that in order to get the temperatures in
these very optically thick regions to be reliable (i.e. not too noisy) you may
need a very large number of photon packages for your simulation, which slows
down the simulation even more. It is hard to prevent such problems. Min,
Dullemond, Dominik, de Koter & Hovenier (2009) A&A 497, 155 discuss two methods
of dealing with this problem. One is a diffusion method, which we will not
discuss here. The other is the 'Modified Random Walk' (MRW) method, based on the
method by Fleck & Canfield (1984) J.Comput.Phys. 54, 508. Note that
Robitaille (2010) A&A 520, 70 presented a simplification of this method. Min et
al. first implemented this method into the MCMax code. It is also implemented in
RADMC-3D, in Robitaille's simplified form.

The crucial idea of the method is that if a photon package 'gets lost' deep
inside a single ultra-optically-thick cell, we can use the analytical solutions
of the diffusion equation in a constant-density medium to predict where the
photon package will go next. This thus allows RADMC-3D to make a single large
step of the photon package which actually corresponds to hundreds or thousands
of absorption+reemission or scattering events.

The method works best if the optically thick cells are as large as possible.
This is because the analytical solutions are only valid within a single cell,
and thus the 'large step' can not be larger than a single cell size.  Moreover,
cell crossings will reduce the step length again to the physical mean free path,
so the more cell crossings are made, the less effective the MRW becomes.

*NOTE:* The MRW is by default switched off. The reason is that it is, after all,
an approximation. However, if RADMC-3D thinks that the MRW may help speed up the
thermal Monte Carlo, it will make the suggestion to the user to switch on the
MRW method.

*NOTE:* So far the MRW method is only implemented using the Planck mean opacity
for estimating the 'large step'. This could, under certain conditions, be
inaccurate. The reason why the (more accurate) Rosseland mean opacity is not
used is that this precludes the precomputation and tabulation of the mean
opacities if multiple independent dust species are used. Strictly speaking,
even the Rosseland mean opacity is not entirely correct, but it is a good
approximation (see Min et al. 2009). So far these simplifications do not seem
to matter a lot. But if strong effects are seen, please report these. Conditions
under which it is likely to make a difference (i.e.  the present implementation
becoming inaccurate) are when an internal heat source inside a super-optically
thick region is introduced (e.g. viscous heating in a disk), and/or when the
opacities are extremely wavelength-dependent (varying by orders of magnitude in
small distances in wavelengths). So please use MRW with care. Upon request we
may implement the true MRW: with the Rosseland mean, which, however, may make
the code slower.

You can switch on the MRW by adding the following line to the
``radmc3d.inp`` file::

  modified_random_walk = 1


.. _sec-dust-ray-tracing:

Making SEDs, spectra, images for dust continuum
===============================================

You can use RADMC-3D for computing spectra and images in dust continuum
emission. This is described in detail in Chapter
:ref:`chap-images-spectra`. RADMC-3D needs to know not only the dust spatial
distribution, given in the file ``dust_density.inp``, but also the
dust temperature, given in the file ``dust_temperature.dat`` (see
Chapter :ref:`chap-binary-io` for the binary version of these files, which
are more compact, and which you can use instead of the ascii versions). The
``dust_temperature.dat`` is normally computed by RADMC-3D itself
through the thermal Monte Carlo computation (see Section
:ref:`sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo`). But if you, the user, wants to specify
the dust temperature at each location in the model youself, then you can
simply create your own file ``dust_temperature.dat`` and skip the
thermal Monte Carlo simulation and go straight to the creation of images or
spectra.

The basic command to make a spectrum at the global grid of wavelength
(specified in the file ``wavelength_micron.inp``,
see Section :ref:`sec-wavelengths`) is::

  radmc3d sed

You can specify the direction of the observer with ``incl`` and ``phi``::

  radmc3d sed incl 20 phi 80

which means: put the observer at inclination 20 degrees and :math:`\phi`-angle
80 degrees.

You can also make a spectrum for a given grid of wavelength (independent of the
global wavelength grid). You first create a file
``camera_wavelength_micron.inp``, which has the same format as
``wavelength_micron.inp``. You can put any set of wavelengths in this file
without modifying the global wavelength grid (which is used by the thermal Monte
Carlo computation). Then you type ::

  radmc3d spectrum loadlambda

and it will create the spectrum on this wavelength grid. More information about
making spectra is given in Chapter :ref:`chap-images-spectra`.

For creating an image you can type ::

  radmc3d image lambda 10

which creates an image at wavelength :math:`\lambda`=10:math:`\mu`\ m. More information
about making images is given in Chapter :ref:`chap-images-spectra`.

*Important note:* To handle scattering of light off dust grains, the ray-tracing
is preceded by a quick Monte Carlo run that is specially designed to compute the
'scattering source function'. This Monte Carlo run is usually *much* faster
than the thermal Monte Carlo run, but must be done at each wavelength. It can
lead, however, to slight spectral noise, because the random photon paths are
different for each wavelength.  See Section :ref:`sec-scattering` for details.


.. _sec-omp-mc:

OpenMP parallelized Monte Carlo
===============================

Depending on the model properties and the number of photon packages used in
the simulation the Monte Carlo calculation (in particular the thermal Monte
Carlo, but under some conditions also the scattering Monte Carlo) can be a
time-consuming computation when executed only in a serial mode. To improve
this, these Monte Carlo calculations can be done in OpenMP parallel mode.
The loop over photon packages is then distributed amongst the different
threads, where each thread adopts a specific number of loop iterations
following the order of the thread identification number. To this end the
random number generator was modified. The important point for the parallel
version is that different threads must not share the same random seed
initially. To be certain that each thread is assigned a different seed at
the beginning, the thread identity number is added to the initial seed.

The default value for the number of threads in the parallel version is set to
one, so that the program is identical with the serial version, except for the
random generator's initial seed. The user can change the value by either typing
``setthreads <nr>``, where ``<nr>`` is the number of requested threads (integer
value) in the command line or by adding a corresponding line to the
``radmc3d.inp`` file. If the chosen number of threads is larger than the
available number of processor cores, the user is asked to reduce it.

For example, you can ask ``radmc3d`` to do the parallelized Monte
Carlo run for you by typing in a shell::

  radmc3d mctherm setthreads 4

or by adding the following keyword to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file::

  setthreads = 4

which means that four threads are used for the thermal Monte Carlo computation.

For the image or spectrum you can do the same: just add ``setthreads 4`` or so
on the command line or put ``setthreads = 4`` into the ``radmc3d.inp`` file.

Make sure that you have included the ``-fopenmp`` keyword in the ``Makefile``
and have compiled the whole ``radmc3d`` source code with this additional command
before using the OpenMP parallelized thermal Monte Carlo version (cf. Section
:ref:`sec-makeing`).


Overview of input data for dust radiative transfer
==================================================

In order to perform any of the actions described in Sections
:ref:`sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo`, :ref:`sec-dust-monochromatic-monte-carlo`
or :ref:`sec-dust-ray-tracing`, you must give RADMC-3D the following 
data:

* ``amr_grid.inp``: The grid file (see Section :ref:`sec-grid-input`).
* ``wavelength_micron.inp``: The global wavelength file (see Section
  :ref:`sec-wavelengths`).
* ``stars.inp``: The locations and properties of stars (see Section
  :ref:`sec-stars`).
* ``dust_density.inp``: The spatial distribution of dust on the grid (see
  Section :ref:`sec-dustdens`).
* ``dustopac.inp``: A file with overall information about the various species of
  dust in the model (see Section :ref:`sec-opacities`).  One of the main pieces
  of information here is (a) how many dust species are included in the model
  and (b) the tag names of these dust species (see ``dustkappa_XXX.inp``
  below). The file ``dust_density.inp`` must contain exactly this number of
  density distributions: one density distribution for each dust species.
* ``dustkappa_XXX.inp``: One or more dust opacity files (where ``XXX`` should in
  fact be a tag name you define, for instance ``dustkappa_silicate.inp``). The
  labels are listed in the ``dustopac.inp`` file. See Section
  :ref:`sec-opacities` for more information.
* ``camera_wavelength_micron.inp (optional)``: This file is only needed if you
  want to create a spectrum at a special set of wavelengths (otherwise use
  ``radmc3d sed``).
* ``mcmono_wavelength_micron.inp (optional)``: This file is only needed if you
  want to compute the radiation field inside the model by calling ``radmc3d
  mcmono`` (e.g. for photochemistry).

Other input files could be required in certain cases, but you will then
be asked about it by RADMC-3D.


.. _sec-dust-monochromatic-monte-carlo:

Special-purpose feature: Computing the local radiation field
============================================================

If you wish to use RADMC-3D for computing the radiation field *inside*
the model, for instance for computing photochemical rates in a chemical model,
then RADMC-3D can do so by calling RADMC-3D in the following way::

  radmc3d mcmono

This computes the mean intensity 

.. math::
 
  J_\nu = \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint I_\nu(\Omega)d\Omega

(in units of
:math:`\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}\,\mathrm{ster}^{-1}`)
as a function of the :math:`(x,y,z)` (cartesian) or :math:`(r,\theta,\phi)`
(spherical) coordinates at frequencies :math:`\nu_i\equiv 10^4c/\lambda_i` where
:math:`\lambda_i` are the wavelengths (in :math:`\mu`\ m) specified in the file ``mcmono_wavelength_micron.inp`` (same format as the file
``wavelength_micron.inp`` which is described in Section
:ref:`sec-wavelengths`). The results of this computation can be interesting for,
for instance, models of photochemistry.

The file that is produced by ``radmc3d mcmono`` is called
``mean_intensity.out`` and has the following form::

  iformat                                  <=== Typically 2 at present
  nrcells
  nfreq                                    <=== Nr of frequencies 
  freq_1 freq_2 ... freq_nfreq             <=== List of frequencies in Hz
  meanint[1,icell=1]
  meanint[1,icell=2]
  ...
  meanint[1,icell=nrcells]
  meanint[2,icell=1]
  meanint[2,icell=2]
  ...
  meanint[2,icell=nrcells]
  ...
  ...
  ...
  meanint[nfreq,icell=1]
  meanint[nfreq,icell=2]
  ...
  meanint[nfreq,icell=nrcells]

The list of frequencies will, in fact, be the same as those listed in the file
``mcmono_wavelength_micron.inp``.

Note that if your model is very large, the computation of the radiation field on
a large set of wavelength could easily overload the memory of the
computer. However, often you are in the end not interested in the entire
spectrum at each location, but just in integrals of this spectrum over some
cross section. For instance, if you want to compute the degree to which dust
shields molecular photodissociation lines in the UV, then you only need to
compute the total photodissociation rate, which is an integral of the
photodissociation cross section times the radiation field. In Section
:ref:`sec-compute-radiation-integrals` it will be explained how you can create a
userdef subroutine (see Chapter :ref:`chap-internal-setup`) that will do this
for you in a memory-saving way.

There is an important parameter for this Monochromatic Monte Carlo that you
may wish to play with:

* ``nphot_mono``
  The parameter ``nphot_mono`` sets the number of photon packages
  that are used for the Monochromatic Monte Carlo simulation. It has as
  default 100000, but that may be too little for 3-D models. You can set
  this value in two ways:

  * In the ``radmc3d.inp`` file as a line ``nphot_mono = 1000000`` for instance.
    
  * On the command-line by adding ``nphot_mono 1000000``.


.. _sec-scattering:

More about scattering of photons off dust grains
================================================

Photons can not only be absorbed and re-emitted by dust grains: They can also be
scattered. Scattering does nothing else than change the direction of propagation
of a photon, and in case polarization is included, its Stokes
parameters. Strictly speaking it may also slightly change its wavelength, if the
dust grains move with considerable speed they may Doppler-shift the wavelength
of the outgoing photon (which may be relevant, if at all, when dust radiative
transfer is combined with line radiative transfer, see chapter
:ref:`chap-line-transfer`), but this subtle effect is not treated in
RADMC-3D. For RADMC-3D scattering is just the changing of direction of a photon.

.. _sec-modes-of-scattering:

Five modes of treating scattering
---------------------------------

RADMC-3D has five levels of realism of treatment of scattering, starting
with ``scattering_mode=1`` (simplest) to ``scattering_mode=5`` (most realistic):

* *No scattering* (``scattering_mode=0``):

  If either the ``dustkappa_XXX.inp`` files do not contain a scattering opacity
  or scattering is switched off by setting ``scattering_mode_max`` to 0 in the
  ``radmc3d.inp`` file, then scattering is ignored. It is then assumed that the
  dust grains have zero albedo.
  
* *Isotropic scattering* (``scattering_mode=1``):
  
  If either the ``dustkappa_XXX.inp`` files do not contain information about the
  anisotropy of the scattering or anisotropic scattering is switched off by
  setting ``scattering_mode_max`` to 1 in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file, then
  scattering is treated as isotropic scattering.  Note that this can be a bad
  approximation.
  
* *Anisotropic scattering using Henyey-Greenstein* (``scattering_mode=2``):
  
  If the ``dustkappa_XXX.inp`` files contain the scattering opacity and the
  :math:`g` parameter of anisotropy (the Henyey-Greenstein :math:`g` parameter
  which is equal, by definition, to :math:`g=\langle\cos\theta\rangle`, where
  :math:`\theta` is the scattering deflection angle), and
  ``scattering_mode_max`` is set to 2 or higher in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file then
  anisotropic scattering is treated using the Henyey-Greenstein approximate
  formula.
  
* *Anisotropic scattering using tabulated phase function* (``scattering_mode=3``):
  
  To treat scattering using a tabulated phase function, you must specify the
  dust opacities using ``dustkapscatmat_XXX.inp`` files instead of the simpler
  ``dustkappa_XXX.inp`` files (see Section :ref:`sec-dustkapscatmat-files`). You
  must also set ``scattering_mode_max`` is set to 3 or higher.
  
* *Anisotropic scattering with polarization for last scattering* (``scattering_mode=4``):
  
  To treat scattering off randomly oriented particles with the full polarization
  you need to set ``scattering_mode_max`` is set to 4 or higher, and you must
  specify the full dust opacity and scattering matrix using the
  ``dustkapscatmat_XXX.inp`` files instead of the simpler ``dustkappa_XXX.inp``
  files (see Section :ref:`sec-dustkapscatmat-files`). If ``scattering_mode=4``
  the full polarization is only done upon the last scattering before light
  reaches the observer (i.e. it is only treated in the computation of the
  scattering source function that is used for the images, but it is not used for
  the movement of the photons in the Monte Carlo simulation).  See Section
  :ref:`sec-polarized-scattering` for more information about polarized
  scattering.
  
* *Anisotropic scattering with polarization, full treatment* (``scattering_mode=5``):
  
  For the full treatment of polarized scattering off randomly oriented
  particles, you need to set ``scattering_mode_max`` is set to 5, and you must
  specify the full dust opacity and scattering matrix using the
  ``dustkapscatmat_XXX.inp`` files instead of the simpler ``dustkappa_XXX.inp``
  files (see Section :ref:`sec-dustkapscatmat-files`).  See Section
  :ref:`sec-polarized-scattering` for more information about polarized
  scattering.  \end{enumerate} Please refer to Sections
  :ref:`sec-scat-phasefunc` and :ref:`sec-polarized-scattering` for more
  information about these different scattering modes.

So in summary: the dust opacity files themselves tell how detailed the
scattering is going to be included. If no scattering information is present in
these files, RADMC-3D has no choice but to ignore scattering. If they only
contain scattering opacities but no phase information (no :math:`g`-factor),
then RADMC-3D will treat scattering in the isotropic approximation. If the
:math:`g`-factor is also included, then RADMC-3D will use the Henyey-Greenstein
formula for anisotropic scattering. If you specify the full scattering matrix
(using the ``dustkapscatmat_XXX.inp`` files instead of the ``dustkappa_XXX.inp``
files) then you can use tabulated scattering phase functions, and even polarized
scattering.

If ``scattering_mode_max`` is *not* set in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file, it is by
default 9999, meaning: RADMC-3D will always use the maximally realistic
scattering mode that the dust opacities allow.

BUT you can always limit the realism of scattering by setting the
``scattering_mode_max`` to 4, 3, 3, 1 or 0 in the file ``radmc3d.inp``. This can
be useful to speed up the calculations or be sure to avoid certain complexities
of the full phase-function treatment of scattering.

At the moment there are some limitations to the full anisotropic scattering
treatment:

* *Anisotropic scattering in 1-D and 2-D Spherical coordinates:*
  
  For 1-D spherical coordinates there is currently no possibility of treating
  anisotropic scattering in the image- and spectrum-making. The reason is that
  the scattering source function (see Section :ref:`sec-scat-monte-carlo`) must
  be stored in an angle-dependent way.  However, for 2-D spherical coordinates,
  this has been implemented, and for each grid 'cell' (actually an annulus) the
  scattering source function is now stored for an entire sequence of angles.
  
* *Full phase functions and polarization only for randomly-oriented particles:*
  
  Currently RADMC-3D cannot handle scattering off fixed-oriented non-spherical
  particles, because it requires a much more detailed handling of the angles. It
  would require at least 3 scattering angles (for axially-symmetric particles)
  or more (for completely asymmetric particles), which is currently beyond the
  scope of RADMC-3D.


.. _sec-scat-phasefunc:

Scattering phase functions
--------------------------

As mentioned above, for the different ``scattering_mode`` settings
you have different levels of realism of treating scattering. 

The transfer equation along each ray, ignoring polarization for now, is:

.. _eq-ray-tracing-rt:

.. math::
   
   \frac{dI_\nu}{ds} = j_\nu^{\mathrm{therm}} + j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}} 
   - (\alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{abs}}+\alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}) I_\nu

where :math:`\alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{abs}}` and :math:`\alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}` are the
extinction coefficients for absorption and scattering.  Let us assume, for
convenience of notation, that we have just one dust species with density
dstribution :math:`\rho`, absorption opacity :math:`\kappa_\nu^{\mathrm{abs}}` and
scattering opacity :math:`\kappa_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}`. We then have

.. _eq-thermal-source-function:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   \alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{abs}} &\equiv \rho\kappa_\nu^{\mathrm{abs}}\\
   \alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}} &\equiv \rho\kappa_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}\\
   j_\nu^{\mathrm{therm}} &= \alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{abs}} B_\nu(T)
   \end{split}
   
where :math:`B_\nu(T)` is the Planck function. The last equation is an
expression of Kirchhoff's law.

For *isotropic* scattering (``scattering_mode=1``) the
scattering source function :math:`j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}` is given by

.. math::

   j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}} = \alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}} \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint I_\nu d\Omega

where the integral is the integral over solid angle. In this case
:math:`j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}` does not depend on solid angle.

For *anisotropic* scattering (``scattering_mode>1``) we
must introduce the scattering phase function
:math:`\Phi({\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}}, {\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}})`, where
:math:`{\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}}` is the unit direction vector for incoming radiation
and :math:`{\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}}` is the unit direction vector for the scattered
radiation. The 
scattering phase function is normalized to unity:

.. math::

   \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint\Phi({\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}},
   {\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}}) d\Omega_{\mathrm{out}}
   =\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint\Phi({\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}},
   {\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}}) d\Omega_{\mathrm{in}}=1

where we integrated over all possible :math:`{\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}}` or
:math:`{\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}}`.
Then the scattering source function becomes:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}({\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}}) = 
   \alpha_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}} \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint I_\nu({\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}})
   \Phi({\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}},{\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}}) d\Omega_{\mathrm{in}}
   \end{split}
   
which is angle-dependent. The angular dependence means: a photon package has not
completely forgotten from which direction it came before hitting the dust grain.

If we do not include the polarization of radiation and we have randomly oriented
particles, then the scattering phase function will only depend on the scattering
(deflection) angle :math:`\theta` defined by

.. math::

   \cos\theta \equiv \mu = {\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}}\cdot {\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}}

We will thus be able to write

.. math::

   \Phi({\bf n}_{\mathrm{in}},{\bf n}_{\mathrm{out}})
   \equiv \Phi(\mu)

where :math:`\Phi(\mu)` is normalized as

.. math::

   \frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^{+1} \Phi(\mu) d\mu = 1

If we have ``scattering_mode=2`` then the phase function is
the Henyey-Greenstein phase function defined as

.. math::

   \Phi(\mu)=\frac{1-g^2}{(1+g^2-2g\mu)^{3/2}}

where the value of the anisotropy parameter :math:`g` is taken from the dust
opacity file. Note that for :math:`g=0` you get :math:`\Phi(\mu)=1` which is the
phase function for isotropic scattering.

If we have ``scattering_mode=3`` then the phase function is
tabulated by you. You have to provide the tabulated phase function as the
:math:`Z_{11}(\theta)` scattering matrix element for a tabulated set of :math:`\theta_i`
values, and this is done in a file ``dustkapscatmat_xxx.inp`` (see
Section :ref:`sec-dustkapscatmat-files` and note that for ``scattering_mode=3``
the other :math:`Z_{ij}` elements can be kept 0 as they are
of no consequence). The relation between :math:`Z_{11}(\theta)` and 
:math:`\Phi(\mu)` is:
 
.. math::

   \Phi(\mu) \equiv \Phi(\cos(\theta)) = \frac{4\pi}{\kappa_{\mathrm{scat}}}\,Z_{11}(\theta)

(which holds at each wavelength individually).

If we have ``scattering_mode=4`` then the scattering in the Monte Carlo code is
done according to the tabulated :math:`\Phi(\mu)` mode mentioned above, but for
computing the scattering source function the full polarized scattering matrix is
used. See Section :ref:`sec-polarized-scattering`.

If we have ``scattering_mode=5`` then the scattering phase function is not only
dependent on :math:`\mu` but also on the other angle.  And it depends on the
polarization state of the input radiation. See Section
:ref:`sec-polarized-scattering`.


.. _sec-scat-in-therm-mc:

Scattering of photons in the Thermal Monte Carlo run
====================================================

So how is scattering treated in practice? In the thermal Monte Carlo model
(Section :ref:`sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo`) the scattering has only one
effect: it changes the direction of propagation of the photon packages whenever
such a photon package experiences a scattering event. This may change the
results for the dust temperatures subtly. In special cases it may even change
the dust temperatures more strongly, for instance if scattering allows 'hot'
photons to reach regions that would have otherwise been in the shadow. It may
also increase the optical depth of an object and thus change the temperatures
accordingly. But this is all there is to it.

If you include the full treatment of polarized scattering
(``scattering_mode=5``), then a photon package also gets polarized when it
undergoes a scattering event. This can affect the phase function for the next
scattering event. This means that the inclusion of the full polarized scattering
processes (as opposed to using non-polarized photon packages) can, at least in
principle, have an effect on the dust temperatures that result from the thermal
Monte Carlo computation. This effect is, however, rather small in practice.


.. _sec-scat-in-mono-mc:

Scattering of photons in the Monochromatic Monte Carlo run
==========================================================

For the monochromatic Monte Carlo calculation for computing the mean intensity
radiation field (Section :ref:`sec-dust-monochromatic-monte-carlo`) the
scattering has the same effect as for the thermal Monte Carlo model: it changes
the direction of photon packages. In this way 'hot' radiation may enter regions
which would otherwise have been in a shadow. And by increasing the optical depth
of regions, it may increase the local radiation field by the greenhouse effect
or decrease it by preventing photons from entering it. As in the thermal Monte
Carlo model the effect of scattering in the monochromatic Monte Carlo model is
simply to change the direction of motion of the radiation field, but for the
rest nothing differs to the case without scattering. Also here the small effects
caused by polarized scattering apply, like in the thermal Monte Carlo case.


.. _sec-scat-monte-carlo:

Scattered light in images and spectra: The 'Scattering Monte Carlo' computation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For making images and spectra with the ray-tracing capabilities of RADMC-3D (see
Section :ref:`sec-dust-ray-tracing` and Chapter :ref:`chap-images-spectra`) the
role of scattering is a much more complex one than in the thermal and
monochromatic Monte Carlo runs. The reason is that the scattered radiation will
eventually end up on your images and spectra.

If we want to make an image or a spectrum, then for each pixel we must integrate
Eq. (:eq:`eq-ray-tracing-rt`) along the 1-D ray belonging to that pixel. If we
performed the thermal Monte Carlo simulation beforehand (or if we specified the
dust temperatures by hand) we know the thermal source function through
Eq. (:ref:`eq-thermal-source-function`). But we have, at that point, no
information yet about the scattering source function. The thermal Monte Carlo
calculation {\em could} have also stored this function at each spatial point and
each wavelength and each observer direction, but that would require gigantic
amounts of memory (for a typical 3-D model it might be many Gbytes, going into
the Tbyte regime). So in RADMC-3D the scattering source function is {\em not}
computed during the thermal Monte Carlo run.

In RADMC-3D the scattering source function :math:`j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}(\Omega')`
is computed {\em just prior to} the ray-tracing through a brief 'Scattering
Monte Carlo' run. This is done {\em automatically} by RADMC-3D, so you
don't have to worry about this. Whenever you ask RADMC-3D to make an image
(and if the scattering is in fact included in the model, see Section
:ref:`sec-modes-of-scattering`), RADMC-3D will automatically realize that it
requires knowledge of :math:`j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}(\Omega')`, and it will start a
brief single-wavelength Monte Carlo simulation for computing
:math:`j_\nu^{\mathrm{scat}}(\Omega')`. This single-wavelength 'Scattering Monte
Carlo' simulation is relatively fast compared to the thermal Monte Carlo
simulation, because photon packages can be destroyed by absorption. So
photon packages do not bounce around for long, as they do in the thermal
Monte Carlo simulation.  This Scattering Monte Carlo simulation is in fact
very similar to the monochromatic Monte Carlo model described in Section
:ref:`sec-dust-monochromatic-monte-carlo`. While the monochromatic Monte
Carlo model is called specifically by the user (by calling RADMC-3D with
``radmc3d mcmono``), the Scattering Monte Carlo simulation is not
something the user must specify him/her-self: it is automatically done by
RADMC-3D if it is needed (which is typically before making an image or
during the making of a spectrum). And while the monochromatic Monte Carlo
model returns the mean intensity inside the model, the Scattering Monte Carlo
simulation provides the raytracing routines with the scattering source
function but does *not* store this function in a file.

You can see this happen if you have a model with scattering opacity included,
and you make an image with RADMC-3D, you see that it prints ``1000``, ``2000``,
``3000``, ... etc., in other words, it performs a little Monte Carlo simulation
before making the image.

There is an important parameter for this Scattering Monte Carlo that you
may wish to play with:

* ``nphot_scat``
  
  The parameter ``nphot_scat`` sets the number of photon packages
  that are used for the Scattering Monte Carlo simulation. It has as default
  100000, but that may be too little for 3-D models and/or cases where you
  wish to reduce the 'streaky' features sometimes visible in
  scattered-light images when too few photon packages are used. You can
  set this value in two ways:

    * In the ``radmc3d.inp`` file as a line ``nphot_scat = 1000000`` for instance.
    * On the command-line by adding ``nphot_scat 1000000``.
      
  In Figure :numref:`fig-polscat` you can see how the quality of an image in 
  scattered light improves when increasing ``nphot_scat``.
  
* ``nphot_spec``
  
  The parameter ``nphot_spec`` is actually exactly the same as
  ``nphot_scat``, but is used (and used only!) for the creation of
  spectra. The default is 10000, i.e. substantially smaller than ``nphot_scat``.
  The reason for this separate parameter is that if you make
  spectra, you integrate over the image to obtain the flux (i.e. the value of
  the spectrum at that wavelength). Even if the scattered light image may
  look streaky, the integral may still be accurate. We can thus afford much
  fewer photon packages when we make spectra than when we make images, and
  can thus speed up the calculation of the spectrum. You can set this value
  in two ways:

    * In the ``radmc3d.inp`` file as a line ``nphot_spec = 100000`` for instance.
    * On the command-line by adding ``nphot_spec 100000``. 

  *NOTE:* It may be possible to get still very good results with even
  smaller values of ``nphot_spec`` than the default value of
  10000. That might speed up the calculation of the spectrum even more in some
  cases. On the other hand, if you notice 'noise' on your spectrum, you may want
  to increase ``nphot_spec``. If you are interested in an optimal balance
  between accuracy (high value of ``nphot_spec``) and speed of calculation (low
  value of ``nphot_spec``) then it is recommended to experiment with this value.
  If you want to be on the safe side, then set ``nphot_spec`` to a high value
  (i.e. set it to 100000, as ``nphot_spec``).

.. _fig-polscat: 

.. figure:: Figures/polscat.*
   :width: 50%

   The effect of ``nphot_scat`` on the image quality when the image is dominated
   by scattered light. The images show the result of model
   ``examples/run_simple_2_scatmat`` at :math:`\lambda=0.84\mu`\ m in which
   polarized scattering with the full scattering phase function and scattering
   matrix is used. See Section :ref:`sec-polarized-scattering` about the
   scattering matrices for polarized scattering. See Section
   :ref:`sec-single-multiple-scattering` for a discussion about the 'scratches'
   seen in the top two panels.

*WARNING:* At wavelengths where the dominant source of photons is thermal dust
emission but scattering is still important (high albedo), it cannot be excluded
that the 'scattering monte carlo' method used by RADMC-3D produces very large
noise. Example: a very optically thick dust disk consisting of large grains (10
:math:`\mu`\ m size), producing thermal dust emission in the near infrared in its
inner disk regions. This thermal radiation can scatter off the large dust grains
at large radii (where the disk is cold and where the only 'emission' in the
near-infrared is thus the scattered light) and thus reveal the outer disk in
scattered light emerging from the inner disk. However, unless ``nphot_scat`` is
huge, most thermally emitted photons from the inner disk will be emitted so
deeply in the disk interior (i.e. below the surface) that they will be
immediately reabsorbed and lost. This means that that radiation that does escape
is extremely noisy. The corresponding scattered light source function at large
radii is therefore very noisy as well, unless ``nphot_scat`` is taken to be
huge. Currently no elegant solution is found, but maybe there will in the 
future. Stay tuned...

*NOTE:* Monte Carlo simulations are based on pseudo-random numbers.
The seed for the random number generator is by default set to -17933201.
If you want to perform multiple identical simulations with a different
random sequence you will need to set the seed by hand. This can be
done by adding a line ::

  iseed = -5415

(where -5415 is to be replaced by the value you want) to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file.

.. _sec-single-multiple-scattering:

Single-scattering vs. multiple-scattering
-----------------------------------------

If scattering is included in the images and spectra, the Monte Carlo run
computes the full multiple-scattering problem. Photon packages are followed as
they scatter and change their direction (possibly many times) until they escape
to infinity or until they are extincted by many orders of magnitude (the exact
extinction limit can be set by ``mc_scat_maxtauabs``, which by default is set to
30, meaning a photon package is considered extincted when it has travelled an
absorption optical depth of 30).

**Important note:** *In many (most?) cases this default value of*
``mc_scat_maxtauabs=30`` *is overly conservative. Especially
when the scattering Monte Carlo is very time-consuming, you may want
to experiment with a lower value. Try adding a line to the*
``radmc3d.inp`` *with*::

  mc_scat_maxtauabs = 5

*This may speed up the scattering Monte Carlo by up to a factor
of 6, while still yielding reasonable results.*

It can be useful to figure out how important the effect of
multiple scattering in an image is compared to single scattering. For
instance: a protoplanetary disk with a 'self-shadowed' geometry will
show some scattering even in the shadowed region because some photon
packages scatter {\em into} the shadowed region and then scatter into
the line of sight. To figure out if this is indeed what happens, you
can make two images: one normal image with ::

  radmc3d image lambda 1.0
  cp image.out image_fullscat.out

and then another image which only treats single scattering::

  radmc3d image lambda 1.0 maxnrscat 1
  cp image.out image_singlescat.out

The command-line option ``maxnrscat 1`` tells RADMC-3D to stop following photon
packages once they hit their first discrete scattering event. You can also check
out the effect of single- and double-scattering (but excluding triple and higher
order scattering) with: ``maxnrscat 2``, etc.

Note that multiple scattering may require a very high number of photon packages
(i.e. setting ``nphot_scat`` to a very high number). For single scattering with
too low ``nphot_scat`` you typically see radial 'rays' in the image emanating
from each stellar source of photons. For multiple scattering, when taking too
low ``nphot_scat`` small you would see strange non-radial 'scratches' in the
image (see Fig. :numref:`fig-polscat`, top two images). It looks as if someone has
used a pen and randomly added some streaks. These streaks are the
double-scattering events which, in that case, apparently are rare enough that
they show up as individual streaks. To test whether these streaks are indeed
such double scattering events, you can use ``maxnrscat 1``, and they should
disappear. If the streaks are indeed very few, it may turn out that the
single-scattering image (``maxnrscat 1``) is almost already the correct
image. The double scattering is then only a minor addition to the image, but due
to the finite Monte Carlo noise it would yield annoying streaks which ruin a
nice image. If you are {\em very sure} that the second scattering and
higher-order scattering are only a very minor effect, then you might use the
``maxnrscat 1`` image as the final image. By comparing the flux in the images
with full scattering and single scattering you can estimate how important the
multiple-scattering contribution is compared to single scattering. But of
course, it is always safer to simply increase ``nphot_scat`` and patiently wait
until the Monte Carlo run is finished.

.. _sec-select-scattering:

Tip: Analyzing the effect of multiple scattering using ``selectscat``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are interested in analyzing the role that multiple scattering plays in your
image (as opposed to single scattering), you can ask RADMC-3D to compute the
scattering source function only for, for instance, the second scattering::

  radmc3d image lambda 1.0 selectscat 2 2

Note that this should not be used for production runs, because the image that
is produced is unphysical (it omits the first and third, fourth etc scatterings).
But it can be useful to get a feeling for how important multiple scattering
is, or to investigate if certain features in your image are due to multiple
scattering or not. You can also select only the first scattering::
  
  radmc3d image lambda 1.0 selectscat 1 1

or all scatterings except the first::

  radmc3d image lambda 1.0 selectscat 2 100000

Note that if you make an image with ``selectscat``, the thermal emission from
the dust is still included (as is the case without ``selectscat``). So if
you want to see *only* the scattered light in the image, you need to manually
set the dust temperature to zero everywhere (in the file ``dust_temperature.dat``,
see Chapter :ref:`chap-input-files`).

Also note that you can use ``selectscat`` also for the monochromatic
Monte Carlo for computing the mean intensity field
(see Section :ref:`sec-dust-monochromatic-monte-carlo`).


.. _sec-simple-single-scattering:

Simplified single-scattering mode (spherical coordinates)
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are sure that multiple scattering is rare (low albedo and/or low optical
depth), then you may be interested in using a simpler (non-Monte-Carlo) mode for
including scattering in your images.  But please first read Section
:ref:`sec-single-multiple-scattering` and test if multiple scattering is indeed
unimportant. If so, and if you are using spherical coordinates, a single star at
the center which is point-like, and if you are confident that at the wavelength
you are interested in the thermal dust emission is not strong enough to be a
considerable source of light that can be scattered into the line-of-sight
(i.e. all scattered light is scattered *star* light), then you can use the
simplified single-scattering mode.

This mode does not use the Monte Carlo method to compute the scattering source
function, but instead uses direct integration of the starlight through the
grid. It is much faster than Monte Carlo, and it does not contain noise.

By adding ``simplescat`` to the command line when making an image or spectrum,
you switch this mode on. Please compare first to the single-scattering Monte
Carlo method (see Section :ref:`sec-single-multiple-scattering`; it should yield
very similar result, but without noise) and then to the full multiple scattering
Monte Carlo. The full multiple scattering case will likely produce more flux. If
the difference is large, then you should not use the simple single scattering
mode. However, if the difference is minor, then the single scattering
approximation is reasonable.

Warning when using an-isotropic scattering
------------------------------------------

An important issue with anisotropic scattering is that if the phase function is
very forward-peaked, then you may get problems with the *spatial* resolution
of your model: it could then happen that one grid cell may be too much to the
left to 'beam' the scattered light into your line of sight, while the next grid
point will be too much to the right. A proper treatment of strongly anisotropic
scattering therefore requires also a good check of the spatial resolution of
your model. There are, however, also two possible tricks (approximations) to
prevent problems. They both involve slight modifications of the dust opacity
files:

* You can simply assure in the opacity files that the forward peaking of
  the phase function has some upper limit.
* Or you can simply treat extremely forward-peaked scattering as no
  scattering at all (simply setting the scattering opacity to zero at those
  wavelengths). 

Both 'tricks' are presumably reasonable and will not affect your results, unless
you concentrate in your modeling very much on the angular dependence of the
scattering.

.. _sec-scat-background:

For experts: Some more background on scattering
-----------------------------------------------

The inclusion of the scattering source function in the images and spectra is a
non-trivial task for RADMC-3D because of memory constraints. If we would have
infinite random access memory, then the inclusion of scattering in the images
and spectra would be relatively easy, as we could then store the entire
scattering source function :math:`j^{\mathrm{scat}}(x,y,z,\nu,\Omega)` and use
what we need at any time. But as you see, this function is a 6-dimensional
function: three spatial dimensions, one frequency and one angular direction
(which consists of two angles). For any respectable model this function is far
too large to be stored. So nearly all the 'numerical logistic' complexity of the
treatment of scattering comes from various ways to deal with this problem. In
principle RADMC-3D makes the choices of which method to use itself, so the user
is not bothered with it. But depending on which kind of model the user sets up,
the performance of RADMC-3D may change as a result of this issue.

So here are a few hints as to the internal workings of RADMC-3D in this
regard. You do not have to read this, but it may help understanding the
performance of RADMC-3D in various cases.

* *Scattering in spectra and multi-wavelength images*

  If no scattering is present in the model (see Section
  :ref:`sec-modes-of-scattering`), then RADMC-3D can save time when making
  spectra and/or multi-wavelength images. I will then do each integration of
  Eq. (:eq:`eq-ray-tracing-rt`) directly for all wavelengths at once before
  going to the next pixel. This saves some time because RADMC-3D then has to
  calculate the geometric stuff (how the ray moves through the model) just once
  for each ray. If, however, scattering is included, the scattering source
  function must be computed using the Scattering Monte Carlo computation. Since
  for large models it would be too memory consuming (in particular for 3-D
  models) to store this function for all positions *and* all wavelengths, it
  must do this calculation one-by-one for each wavelength, and calculate the
  image for that wavelength, and then go off to the next wavelength. This means
  that for each ray (pixel) the geometric computations (where the ray moves
  through the model) has to be redone for each new wavelength. This may slow
  down the code a bit.

* *Anisotropic scattering and multi-viewpoint images*
  
  Suppose we wish to look at an object at one single wavelength, but from a
  number of different vantage points. If we have {\em isotropic} scattering,
  then we need to do the Scattering Monte Carlo calculation just once, and we
  can make multiple images at different vantage points with the same scattering
  source function. This saves time, if you use the 'movie' mode of RADMC-3D
  (Section :ref:`sec-movie-mode`). However, if the scattering is anisotropic,
  then the source function would differ for each vantage point.  In that case
  the scattering source function must be recalculated for each vantage
  point. There is, deeply hidden in RADMC-3D, a way to compute scattering source
  functions for multiple vantage points within a single Scattering Monte Carlo
  run, but for the moment this is not yet activated.  \end{itemize}


.. _sec-polarized-scattering:

Polarization, Stokes vectors and full phase-functions
=====================================================

The module in RADMC-3D that deals with polarization
(``polarization_module.f90``) is based on code developed by Michiel Min for his
MCMAX code, and has been used and modified for use in RADMC-3D with his
permission.

Radiative transfer of polarized radiation is a relatively complex issue. A good
and extensive review on the details of polarization is given in the book by
Mishchenko, Travis & Lacis, 'Scattering, Absorption and Emission of Light by
Small Particles', 2002, Cambridge University Press (also electronically
available on-line). Another good book (and a classic!)  is the book by Bohren &
Huffman 'Absorption and scattering of light by small particles',
Wiley-VCH. Finally, the ultimate classic is the book by van de Hulst 'Light
scattering by small particles', 1981. For some discussions on how polarization
can be built in into radiative transfer codes, see e.g. Wolf, Voshchinnikov &
Henning (2002, A&A 385, 365).
 
When we wish to include polarization in our model we must follow not just the
intensity :math:`I` of light (or equivalently, the energy :math:`E` of a photon
package), but the full Stokes vector :math:`(I,Q,U,V)` (see review above for
definitions, or any textbook on radiation processes). If a photon scatters off a
dust grain, then the scattering angular probability density function depends not
only on the scattering angle :math:`\mu`, but also on the input state of
polarization, i.e. the values of :math:`(I,Q,U,V)`. And the output polarization
state will be modified. Moreover, even if we would not be interested in
polarization at all, but we {\em do} want to have a correct scattering phase
function, we need to treat polarization, because a first scattering will
polarize the photon, which will then have different angular scattering
probability in the next scattering event. Normally these effects are very small,
so if we are not particularly interested in polarization, one can usually ignore
this effect without too high a penalty in reliability. But if one wants to be
accurate, there is no way around a full treatment of the :math:`(I,Q,U,V)`.

Interaction between polarized radiation with matter happens through so-called
Müller matrices, which are :math:`4\times 4` matrices that can be multiplied by
the :math:`(I,Q,U,V)` vector. More on this later.

It is important to distinguish between two situations:

#. The simplest case (and fortunately applicable in many cases) is if all
   dust particles are *randomly oriented*, and there is *no
   preferential helicity* of the dust grains (i.e. for each particle shape
   there are equal numbers of particles with that shape and with its mirror
   copy shape). This is also automatically true if all grains are spherically
   symmetric. In this case the problem of polarized radiative transfer
   simplifies in several ways:
  
   * The scattering Müller matrix simplifies, and contains only 6
     independent matrix elements (see later). Moreover, these matrix elements
     depend only on a single angle: the scattering angle :math:`\theta`, and of
     course on the wavelength. This means that the amount of information is
     small enough that these Müller matrix elements can be stored in
     computer memory in tabulated form, so that they do not have to be
     calculated real-time.
   * The total scattering cross section is independent of the input
     polarization state. Only the output radiation (i.e. in which
     direction the photon will scatter) depends on the input polarization
     state. 
   * The absorption cross section is the same for all components of
     the :math:`(I,Q,U,V)`-vector. In other words: the absorption Müller
     matrix is the usual scalar absorption coefficient times the unit
     matrix. 
 
   The last two points assure that most of the structure of the RADMC-3D code
   for non-polarized radiation can remain untouched. Only for computing the
   new direction and polarization state of a photon after a scattering event
   in the Monte Carlo module, as well as for computing the scattering source
   function in the Monte Carlo module (for use in the camera module) we must
   do extra work. Thermal emission and thermal absorption remain the same,
   and computing optical depths remains also the same.
  
#. A (much!) more complex situation arises if dust grains are *non-spherical*
   and are somehow *aligned due to external forces*. For
   instance, particles tend to align themselves in the interstellar medium if
   strong enough magnetic fields are present. Or particles tend to align
   themselves due to the combination of gravity and friction if they are in a
   planetary/stellar atmosphere. Here are the ways in which things become more
   complex:
  
   * All the scattering Müller matrix components will become
     non-zero and independent. We will thus get 16 independent variables.
   * The matrix elements will depend on four angles, of which one can,
     in some cases, be removed due to symmetry (e.g. if we have gravity,
     there is still a remaining rotational symmetry; same is true of
     particles are aligned by a :math:`\vec B`-field; but if both gravity and a
     :math:`\vec B`-field are present, this symmetry may get lost). It will in
     most practical circumstances not be possible to precalculate the
     scattering Müller matrix beforehand and tabulate it, because there
     are too many variables. The matrix must be computed on-the-fly.
   * The total scattering cross section now *does* depend on the
     polarization state of the input photon, and on the incidence angle.
     This means that scattering extinction becomes anisotropic.
   * Thermal emission and absorption extinction will also no longer
     be isotropic. Moreover, they are no longer scalar: they are described
     by a non-trivial Müller matrix.

   The complexity of this case is rather large. As of version 0.41 we
   have included polarized thermal emission by aligned grains (see
   Section :ref:`sec-polarized-thermal-emission`), and we will
   implement more of the above mentioned aspects of aligned grains
   step by step.

   
.. _sec-definitions-stokes:
 
Definitions and conventions for Stokes vectors
----------------------------------------------

There are different conventions for how to set up the coordinate system and
define the Stokes vectors. Our definition follows the IAU 1974 definition as
described in Hamaker & Bregman (1996) A&AS 117, pp.161.

In this convention the :math:`x'` axis points to the north on the sky, while the
:math:`y'` axis points to the east on the sky (but see the 'important note'
below). The :math:`z'` axis points to the observer. This coordinate system is
positively right-handed. The radiation moves toward positive :math:`z'`. Angles
in the :math:`(x',y')` plane are measured counter-clockwise (angle=0 means
positive :math:`x'` direction, angle=\ :math:`\pi/2` means positive :math:`y'`
direction).

In the following we will (still completely consistent with the IAU definitions
above, see the 'important note' below) define "up" to be positive :math:`y'` and
"right" to be positive :math:`x'`. So, the :math:`(x',y')` coordinates are in a
plane perpendicular to the photon propagation, and oriented as seen by the
observer of that photon. So the direction of propagation is toward you, while
:math:`y'` points up and :math:`x'` points to the right, just as one would
normally orient it.

*Important Note*: This is fully equivalent to adjusting the IAU 1974 definition
to have :math:`x'` pointing west and :math:`y'` pointing north, which is perhaps
more intuitive, since most images in the literature have this orientation. So
for convenience of communication, let us simply adjust the IAU 1974 definition
to have positive :math:`x'` ('right') pointing west and positive :math:`y'`
('up') pointing north.  It will have no further consequences for the definitions
and internal workings of RADMC-3D because RADMC-3D does not know what 'north'
and 'east' are.

The :math:`(Q,U)` definition (linear polarization) is such that a linearly
polarized ray with :math:`Q=+I`, :math:`U=V=0` has the electric field in the
:math:`(x',y')=(1,0)` direction, while :math:`Q=-I`, :math:`U=V=0` has the
electric field in the :math:`(x',y')=(0,1)` direction. If we have :math:`Q=0`,
:math:`U=+I`, :math:`V=0` then the E-field points in the :math:`x'=y'`
direction, while :math:`Q=0`, :math:`U=-I`, :math:`V=0` the E-field points in
the :math:`x'=-y'` direction (see Figure 1 of Hamaker & Bregman 1996).

The :math:`(V)` definition (circular polarization) is such that (quoting
directly from the Hamaker & Bregman paper): *For right-handed circularly
polarized radiation, the position angle of the electric vector at any point
increases with time; this implies that the* :math:`y'` *component of the field
lags the* :math:`x'` *component. Also the electric vectors along the line of sight
form a left-handed screw. The Stokes* :math:`V` *is positive for
right-handed circular polarization.*

   The definition of the Stokes parameters used in RADMC-3D, which is consistent
   with the IAU 1974 definitions (see Hamaker & Bregman (1996) A&AS 117,
   pp.161). First panel shows that positive angle means counter-clockwise. In
   the second to fourth panels the fat lines show how the tip of the real
   electric field vector goes as a function of time for an observer at a fixed
   location in space watching the radiation. The radiation moves toward the
   reader. We call the second panel (:math:`Q=+I`) 'horizontally polarized', the
   third panel (:math:`U=+I`) 'diagonally polarized by +45 degrees' and the
   fourth panel (:math:`V=+I`) 'right-handed circularly polarized'. In the
   images produced by RADMC-3D (``image.out``, see Section :ref:`sec-image-out`
   and Fig. :numref:`fig-cameraorient`) the :math:`x'` direction is the horizontal
   direction and the :math:`y'` direction is the vertical direction.

We can put these definitions into the standard formulae:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   Q &= I\cos(2\beta)\cos(2\chi)\\
   U &= I\cos(2\beta)\sin(2\chi)\\
   V &= I\sin(2\beta)
   \end{split}

The angle :math:`\chi` is the angle of the E-field in the :math:`(x',y')`
coordinates, measured counter-clockwise from :math:`x'` (consistent with our
definition of angles). Example: :math:`\chi` = 45 deg = :math:`\pi/4`, then
:math:`\cos(2\chi)=0` and :math:`\sin(2\chi)=1`, meaning that :math:`Q=0` and
:math:`U/I=+1`. Indeed this is consistent with the above definition that
:math:`U/I=+1` is :math:`E_x'=E_y'`.

The angle :math:`2\beta` is the phase difference between the
:math:`y'`-component of the E-field and the :math:`x'`-component of the E-field
such that for :math:`0<\beta<\pi/2` the E-field rotates in a counter-clockwise
sense. In other words: the :math:`y'`-wave lags :math:`2\beta` behind the
:math:`x'` wave. Example: if we have :math:`\beta=\pi/4`, i.e.
:math:`2\beta=\pi/2`, then :math:`\cos(2\beta)=0` and :math:`\sin(2\beta)=1`, so
we have :math:`Q=U=0` and :math:`V/I=+1`. This corresponds to the :math:`y'`
wave being lagged :math:`\pi/2` behind the :math:`x'` wave, meaning that we have
a counter-clockwise rotation. If we use the right-hand-rule and point the thumb
into the direction of propagation (toward us) then the fingers indeed point in
counter-rotating direction, meaning that :math:`V/I=+1` is righthanded polarized
radiation.

In terms of the *real* electric fields of a plane monochromatic wave:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   E_x'(t) &= E_h \cos(\omega t-\Delta_h)\\
   E_y'(t) &= E_v \cos(\omega t-\Delta_v)
   \end{split}
   
(with :math:`E_h>0` and :math:`E_v>0` and :math:`\Delta_{h,v}` are the phase
lags of the components with respect to some arbitrary phase) we can write the
Stokes components as:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   I &= E_h^2 + E_v^2 \\
   Q &= E_h^2 - E_v^2\\
   U &= 2 E_h E_v \cos(\Delta) \\
   V &= 2 E_h E_v \sin(\Delta)
   \end{split}

with :math:`\Delta = \Delta_v - \Delta_h = 2\beta`.

In terms of the {\em complex} electric fields of a plane monochromatic wave
(the sign before the :math:`i\omega t` is important):

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   E_x'(t) &= E_h e^{i(\Delta_h-\omega t)}\\
   E_y'(t) &= E_v e^{i(\Delta_v-\omega t)}
   \end{split}
  
(with :math:`E_h>0` and :math:`E_v>0` real numbers and :math:`\Delta_{h,v}` are
the phase lags of the components with respect to some arbitrary phase) we can
write the Stokes components as:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   I &= \langle E_{x'}E_{x'}^{*} + E_{y'}E_{y'}^{*}   \rangle\\
   Q &= \langle E_{x'}E_{x'}^{*} - E_{y'}E_{y'}^{*}   \rangle\\
   U &= \langle E_{x'}E_{y'}^{*} + E_{y'}E_{x'}^{*}   \rangle\\
   V &= i\langle E_{x'}E_{y'}^{*} - E_{y'}E_{x'}^{*}  \rangle
   \end{split}


.. _sec-stokes-convent-differences:

Our conventions compared to other literature
--------------------------------------------

The IAU 1974 definition is different from the definitions used in the
Planck mission, for instance. So be careful. There is something said about
this on the website of the healpix software
http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/html/intronode12.htm .

Our definition is also different from the Mishchenko book and papers (see
below). Compared to the books of Mishchenko and Bohren & Huffman, our
definitions are:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   I_{\mathrm{ours}} &=  I_{\mathrm{mishch}}  = I_{\mathrm{bohrenhuffman}} \\
   Q_{\mathrm{ours}} &=  Q_{\mathrm{mishch}}  = Q_{\mathrm{bohrenhuffman}} \\
   U_{\mathrm{ours}} &=  -U_{\mathrm{mishch}} = -U_{\mathrm{bohrenhuffman}} \\
   V_{\mathrm{ours}} &=  -V_{\mathrm{mishch}} = -V_{\mathrm{bohrenhuffman}}
   \end{split}
   
As you see: only the :math:`U` and :math:`V` change sign. For a :math:`4\times 4`
Müller matrix :math:`M` this means that the :math:`M_{II}`, :math:`M_{IQ}`,
:math:`M_{QI}`, :math:`M_{QQ}`, as well as the :math:`M_{UU}`, :math:`M_{UV}`,
:math:`M_{VU}`, :math:`M_{VV}` stay the same, while :math:`M_{IU}`,
:math:`M_{IV}`, :math:`M_{QU}`, :math:`M_{QV}`, as well as :math:`M_{UI}`,
:math:`M_{UQ}`, :math:`M_{VI}`, :math:`M_{VQ}` components would flip sign.

Compared to Mishchenko, Travis & Lacis book, what we call :math:`x'` they call
:math:`\theta` and what we call :math:`y'` they call :math:`\phi`. In their
Figure 1.3 (which describes the definition of the Stokes parameters) they have
the :math:`\theta` direction pointing downward, rather than toward the right,
i.e. rotated by 90 degrees clockwise compared to RADMC-3D. However, since
RADMC-3D does not know what 'right' or 'down' are (only what :math:`x'` and
:math:`y'` are) this rotation is merely a difference in how we plot things in a
figure, and has no consequences for the results, as long as we define how
:math:`x'` and :math:`y'` are oriented compared to our model (see
Fig. :numref:`fig-cameraorient` where :math:`x_{\mathrm{image}}` is our :math:`x'`
here and likewise for :math:`y'`).

Bohren & Huffman have the two unit vectors plotted in the following way:
:math:`{\bf e}_{\parallel}` is plotted horizontally to the left and :math:`{\bf
e}_{\perp}` is plotted vertically upward. Compared to us, our :math:`x'` points
toward {\em minus} their :math:`{\bf e}_{\parallel}`, while our :math:`y'`
points toward their :math:`{\bf e}_{\perp}`, but since they plot their
:math:`{\bf e}_{\parallel}` to the left, the orientation of our plot and their
plots are consistent (i.e. if they say 'pointing to the right', they mean the
same direction as we). But their definition of 'right-handed circular
polarization' (clockwise when seen toward the source of the radiation) is our
'left handed'.

The book by Wendisch & Yang 'Theory of Atmospheric Radiative Transfer' uses the
same conventions as Bohren & Huffman, but their basis vector :math:`{\bf
e}_{\parallel}` is plotted vertically and :math:`{\bf e}_{\perp}` is plotted
horizontally to the right. This only affects what they call 'horizontal' and
'vertical' but the math stays the same.

Our definition is identical to the one on the *English* Wikipedia page on Stokes
parameters http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_parameters (on 2 January 2013),
with the only exception that what they call 'righthanded' circularly polarized,
we call 'lefthanded'. This is just a matter of nomenclature of what is
right/left-handed, and since RADMC-3D does not know what 'right/lefthanded' is,
this difference has no further consequences. *Note*, however, that the same
Wikipedia page in different languages use different conventions! For instance,
the German version of the page (on 2 January 2013) has the same Q and U
definitions, but has the sign of V flipped.

Note that in RADMC-3D we have no global definition of the orientation of
:math:`x'` and :math:`y'` (see e.g. Section
:ref:`sec-orientation-vector-stokes`). If we make an image with RADMC-3D, then
the horizontal (x-) direction in the image corresponds to :math:`x'` and the
vertical (y-) direction corresponds to :math:`y'`, just as one would expect. So
if you obtain an image from RADMC-3D and all the pixels in the image have
:math:`Q=I` and :math:`U=V=0`, then the electric field points horizontally in
the image.


.. _sec-orientation-vector-stokes:

Defining orientation for non-observed radiation
-----------------------------------------------

To complete our description of the Stokes parameters we still need to define in
which direction we let :math:`x'` and :math:`y'` point if we do *not* have an
obvious observer, i.e. for radiation moving through our object of interest which
may never reach us. In the Monte Carlo modules of RADMC-3D, when polarization is
switched on, any photon package does not only have a wavelength :math:`\lambda`
and a direction of propagation :math:`{\bf n}` associated with it, but also a
second unit vector :math:`{\bf S}`, which is always assured to obey:

.. math::
   
   |{\bf S}| = 1 \qquad \hbox{and} \qquad {\bf S}\cdot{\bf n}=0

This leaves, for a given :math:`{\bf n}`, one degree of freedom (any direction
as long as it is perpendicular to :math:`{\bf n}`). It is irrelevant which
direction is chosen for this, but whatever choice is made, it sets the
definitions of the :math:`x'` and :math:`y'` directions. The definitions are:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   x' &= \quad\hbox{points in the direction}\quad {\bf S}\times {\bf n}\\
   y' &= \quad\hbox{points in the direction}\quad {\bf S}\\
   z' &= \quad\hbox{points in the direction}\quad {\bf n}
   \end{split}

So for :math:`Q=-I`, :math:`U=V=0` the electric field points in the direction of
:math:`{\bf S}`, while for :math:`Q=+I`, :math:`U=V=0` it is perpendicular to
both :math:`{\bf n}` and :math:`{\bf S}`.

However, if you are forced to change the direction of :math:`{\bf S}` for whatever
reason, the Stokes components will also change. This coordinate transformation
works as follows.
We can transform from a '-basis to a ''-basis by rotating the :math:`{\bf S}`-vector
counter-clockwise (as seen by the observer watching the radiation) by an
angle :math:`\alpha`. Any vector :math:`(x',y')` in the '-basis will become a vector
:math:`(x'',y'')` in a ''-basis, given by the transformation:

.. math::
      
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   x''\\y''
   \end{matrix}\right)
   =
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \cos(\alpha) & \sin(\alpha)\\
   -\sin(\alpha) & \cos(\alpha)
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   x'\\y'
   \end{matrix}\right)
   
NOTE: We choose :math:`(x',y')` to be the usual counter-clockwise basis for the
observer seeing the radiation. Rotating the basis in counter-clockwise direction
means rotating the vector in that basis in clockwise direction, hence the sign
convention in the matrix.

If we have :math:`(I,Q,U,V)` in the '-basis (which we might have written as
:math:`(I',Q',U',V')` but by convention we drop the '), the
:math:`(I'',Q'',U'',V'')` in the ''-basis becomes

.. math::

   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I''\\Q''\\U''\\V''
   \end{matrix}\right)
   =
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \cos(2\alpha) & \sin(2\alpha) & 0 \\
   0 & -\sin(2\alpha) & \cos(2\alpha) & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I\\Q\\U\\V
   \end{matrix}\right)



Polarized scattering off dust particles: general formalism
----------------------------------------------------------

Suppose we have *one* dust particle of mass :math:`m_{\mathrm{grain}}` and we
place it at location :math:`{\bf x}`. Suppose this particle is exposed to a
plane wave of electromagnetic radiation pointing in direction :math:`{\bf
n}_{\mathrm{in}}` with a flux :math:`{\bf F}_{\mathrm{in}}=F_{\mathrm{in}}\,{\bf
n}_{\mathrm{in}}`. This radiation can be polarized, so that
:math:`F_{\mathrm{in}}` actually is a Stokes vector:

.. math::

   F_{\mathrm{in}} = \left(\begin{matrix}
   F_{I,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{Q,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{U,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{V,\mathrm{in}}
   \end{matrix}\right)

This particle will scatter some of this radiation into all directions. 
What will the flux of scattered radiation be, as observed at location
:math:`{\bf y}\neq{\bf x}`? Let us define the vector

.. math::

   {\bf r} = {\bf y} - {\bf x}

its length

.. math::

   r = |{\bf r}|

and the unit vector

.. math::

   {\bf e}_r = \frac{{\bf r}}{r}

We will assume that :math:`r\gg a` where :math:`a` is the particle size.  We
define the {\em scattering matrix elements} :math:`Z_{ij}` (with :math:`i,j` =
:math:`1,2,3,4`) such that the measured outgoing flux from the particle at
:math:`{\bf y}` is

.. math::

   {\bf F}_{\mathrm{out}} = F_{\mathrm{out}}{\bf e}_r

.. math::

   F_{\mathrm{out}} = \left(\begin{matrix}
   F_{I,\mathrm{out}}\\
   F_{Q,\mathrm{out}}\\
   F_{U,\mathrm{out}}\\
   F_{V,\mathrm{out}}
   \end{matrix}\right)
   =\frac{m_{\mathrm{grain}}}{r^2}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   Z_{11} & Z_{12} & Z_{13} & Z_{14} \\
   Z_{21} & Z_{22} & Z_{23} & Z_{24} \\
   Z_{31} & Z_{32} & Z_{33} & Z_{34} \\
   Z_{41} & Z_{42} & Z_{43} & Z_{44}
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   F_{I,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{Q,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{U,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{V,\mathrm{in}}
   \end{matrix}\right)

The values :math:`Z_{ij}` depend on the direction into which the radiation is
scattered (i.e. :math:`{\bf e}_r`) and on the direction of the incoming flux
(i.e. :math:`{\bf n}`), but not on :math:`r`: the radial dependence of the
outgoing flux is taken care of through the :math:`1/r^2` factor in the above
formula.

Some notes about our conventions are useful at this place. In many books the
'scattering matrix' is written as :math:`F_{ij}` instead of :math:`Z_{ij}`, and is
defined as the :math:`Z_{ij}` for the case when radiation comes from one
particular direction: :math:`{\bf n}=(0,0,1)`\ . In this manual and in the RADMC-3D
code, however, we will always write :math:`Z_{ij}`, because the symbol :math:`F` can be
confused with flux. The normalization of these matrix elements is also
different in different books. In our case it has the dimension
:math:`\mathrm{cm}^2\;\mathrm{gram}^{-1}\;\mathrm{ster}^{-1}`\ .
The conversion from the conventions of other books is
(where :math:`k=2\pi/\lambda` is the wave number in units of 1/cm):

.. math::

   Z_{ij,\mathrm{RADMC-3D}} = \frac{Z_{ij,\mathrm{Mishchenko}}}{m_{\mathrm{grain}}}
   = \frac{S_{ij,\mathrm{BohrenH}}}{k^2m_{\mathrm{grain}}}

except that for the :math:`Z_{13}`, :math:`Z_{14}`, :math:`Z_{23}`,
:math:`Z_{24}`, :math:`Z_{31}`, :math:`Z_{41}`, :math:`Z_{32}`, :math:`Z_{42}`
elements (if non-zero) there must be a minus sign before the
:math:`Z_{ij,\mathrm{RADMC-3D}}` because of the opposite :math:`U` and :math:`V`
sign conventions (see Section :ref:`sec-stokes-convent-differences`).

Note that the :math:`S_{ij,\mathrm{BohrenH}}` are the matrix elements obtained
from the famous ``BHMIE.F`` code from the Bohren & Huffman book
(see Chapter :ref:`chap-acquiring-opacities`). 

Polarized scattering off dust particles: randomly oriented particles
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the special case in which we either have spherical particles or we
average over a large number of randomly oriented particles, the :math:`Z_{ij}`
elements are no longer dependent on *both* :math:`{\bf e}_r` and :math:`{\bf n}` but
only on the angle between them:

.. math::

   \cos\theta = {\bf n}\cdot{\bf e}_r

So we go from :math:`Z_{ij}({\bf n},{\bf e}_r)`, i.e. a four-angle dependence, to
:math:`Z_{ij}(\theta)`, i.e. a one-angle dependence. 

Now let us also assume that there is no netto helicity of the particles
(they are either axisymmetric or there exist equal amounts of particles
as their mirror symmetric counterparts). In that case (see e.g. 
Mishchenko book) of the 16 matrix elements only 6 are non-zero and independent:

.. _eq-scatmat-for-randorient-nohelic:

.. math::

   F_{\mathrm{out}} = \left(\begin{matrix}
   F_{I,\mathrm{out}}\\
   F_{Q,\mathrm{out}}\\
   F_{U,\mathrm{out}}\\
   F_{V,\mathrm{out}}
   \end{matrix}\right)
   =\frac{m_{\mathrm{grain}}}{r^2}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   Z_{11} & Z_{12} & 0 & 0 \\
   Z_{12} & Z_{22} & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & Z_{33} & Z_{34} \\
   0 & 0 & -Z_{34} & Z_{44}
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   F_{I,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{Q,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{U,\mathrm{in}}\\
   F_{V,\mathrm{in}}
   \end{matrix}\right)

This is the case for scattering in RADMC-3D. Note that in Mie scattering the
number of independent matrix elements reduces to just 4 because then
:math:`Z_{22}=Z_{11}` and :math:`Z_{44}=Z_{33}`. But RADMC-3D also allows for
cases where :math:`Z_{22}\neq Z_{11}` and :math:`Z_{44}\neq Z_{33}`, i.e. for
opacities resulting from more detailed calculations such as DDA or T-matrix
calculations.

Now, as described above, the Stokes vectors only have meaning if the directions
of :math:`x'` and :math:`y'` are well-defined. For
Eq. (:ref:`eq-scatmat-for-randorient-nohelic`) to be valid (and for the correct
meaning of the :math:`Z_{ij}` elements) the following definition is used: Before
the scattering, the :math:`{\bf S}`-vector of the photon package is rotated (and
the Stokes vectors accordingly transformed) such that the new :math:`{\bf
S}`-vector is perpendicular to both :math:`{\bf n}` and :math:`{\bf e}_r`. In
other words, the scattering angle :math:`\theta` is a rotation of the photon
propagation around the (new) :math:`{\bf S}`-vector. The sign convention is such
that

.. math::

   ({\bf n}\times {\bf e}_r)\cdot{\bf S}=\sin(\theta)

In other words, if we look into the incoming light (with :math:`z'` pointing
toward us), then for :math:`\sin(\theta)>0` the photon is scattered into the
:math:`x'>0`, :math:`y'=0` direction (i.e. for us it is scattered to the
right).  The :math:`{\bf S}` vector for the outgoing photon remains unchanged,
since the new :math:`{\bf n}` is also perpendicular to it.

So what does this all mean for the opacity? The scattering opacity tells us
how much of the incident radiation is removed and converted into outgoing
scattered radiation. The absorption opacity tells us how much of the
incident radiation is removed and converted into heat. For randomly oriented
particles without netto helicity both opacities are independent of the
polarization state of the radiation. Moreover, the thermal emission
is unpolarized in this case. This means that in the radiative
transfer equation the extinction remains simple:

.. _eq-radtrans-randomorient:

.. math::

   \frac{d}{ds}\left(
   \begin{matrix}
   I_I\\I_Q\\I_U\\I_V
   \end{matrix}
   \right)
   =
   \left(
   \begin{matrix}
   j_{\mathrm{emis},I}\\0\\0\\0
   \end{matrix}
   \right)
   +
   \left(
   \begin{matrix}
   j_{\mathrm{scat},I}\\j_{\mathrm{scat},Q}\\j_{\mathrm{scat},U}\\j_{\mathrm{scat},V}
   \end{matrix}
   \right)
   -\rho(\kappa_{\mathrm{abs}}+\kappa_{\mathrm{scat}})
   \left(
   \begin{matrix}
   I_I\\I_Q\\I_U\\I_V
   \end{matrix}
   \right)

where :math:`I_I`, :math:`I_Q`, :math:`I_U`, :math:`I_V` are the intensities
(:math:`\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}\,\mathrm{ster}^{-1}`)
for the four Stokes parameters, and likewise for
:math:`j_{\mathrm{emis}}` and :math:`j_{\mathrm{scat}}`, and finally, :math:`s`
the path length along the ray under consideration. Note that if we would allow
for fixed-orientation dust particles (which we don't),
Eq. (:ref:`eq-radtrans-randomorient`) would become considerably more complex,
with extinction being matrix-valued and thermal emission being polarized.

Since :math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{scat}}` converts incoming radiation into outgoing
scattered radiation, it should be possible to calculate
:math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{scat}}` from angular integrals of the scattering matrix
elements. For randomly oriented non-helical particles we indeed have:

.. _eq-scatmat-selfconsist-kappa:

.. math::

   \kappa_{\mathrm{scat}} = \oint Z_{11} d\Omega = 
   2\pi \int_{-1}^{+1}Z_{11}(\mu)d\mu

where :math:`\mu=\cos\theta`. In a similar exercise we can calculate the
anisotropy factor :math:`g` from the scattering matrix elements:

.. _eq-scatmat-selfconsist-g:

.. math::

   g = \frac{2\pi}{\kappa_{\mathrm{scat}}}\int_{-1}^{+1}Z_{11}(\mu)\mu d\mu

This essentially completes the description of scattering as it is implemented in
RADMC-3D.

We can precalculate the :math:`Z_{ij}(\theta)` for every wavelength and for a
discrete set of values of :math:`\theta`, and store these in a table. This is
indeed the philosophy of RADMC-3D: You have to precompute them using, for
instance, the Mie code of Bohren and Huffman (see Chapter
:ref:`chap-acquiring-opacities` for RADMC-3D compliant wrappers around that
code), and then provide them to RADMC-3D through a file called
``dustkapscatmat_xxx.inp`` (where ``xxx`` is the name of the dust species) which
is described in Section :ref:`sec-dustkapscatmat-files`.  This file provides not
only the matrix elements, but also the :math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs}}`,
:math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{scat}}` and :math:`g` (the anisotropy factor). RADMC-3D
will then internally check that Eqs.(:ref:`eq-scatmat-selfconsist-kappa`,
:ref:`eq-scatmat-selfconsist-g`) are indeed fulfilled. If not, an error message
will result.

One more note: As mentioned in Section :ref:`sec-definitions-stokes`, the sign
conventions of the Stokes vector components we use (the IAU 1974 definition) are
different from the Bohren & Huffman and Mishchenko books. For randomly oriented
particles, however, the sign conventions of the :math:`Z`-matrix elements are
not affected, because those matrix elements that would be affected are those
that are in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants of the matrix, and these
elements are anyway zero. So we can use, for randomly oriented particles, the
matrix elements from those books and their computer codes without having to
adjust the signs.


Scattering and axially symmetric models
---------------------------------------

In spherical coordinates it is possible in RADMC-3D to set up axially symmetric
models. The trick is simply to set the number of :math:`\phi` coordinate points
``nphi`` to 1 and to switch off the :math:`\phi`-dimension in the grid (see
Section :ref:`sec-grid-input`). For isotropic scattering this mode has always
been implemented. But for anisotropic scattering things become more complex. For
such a model the scattering remains a fully 3-D problem: the scattering source
function has to be stored not only as a function of :math:`r` and
:math:`\theta`, but also as a function of :math:`\phi` (for a given observer
vantage point). The reason is that anisotropic scattering {\em does} care about
viewing angle (in contrast to isotropic scattering). So even though for an
axisymmetric model the density and temperature functions only depend on
:math:`r` and :math:`\theta` (and are therefore mathematically 2-D), the
scattering source function depends on :math:`r`, :math:`\theta` and
:math:`\phi`.

For this reason anisotropic scattering was, until version 0.40, not allowed for
2-D axisymmetric models. As of version 0.41 it is now possible to use the full
polarized scattering mode (``scattering_mode=5``) also for 2-D axisymmetric
models. The intermediate scattering modes (``scattering_mode=2, 3, 4``) remain
incompatible with 2-D axisymmetry.  Isotropic scattering remains, as before,
fully compatible with 2-D axisymmetry.

One note of explanation: the way the full scattering is now implemented into
the case of 2-D axisymmetry is the following: internally we compute not just
the scattering source function for one angle, but for a whole set of :math:`\phi`
angles (even though the grid has no :math:`\phi`-points). Each time a photon in
the scattering Monte Carlo simulation enters a cell (which in 2-D
axisymmetry is an annulus), a loop over 360 :math:`\phi` angles is performed, and
the scattering source function is computed for all of these angles.  {\em
This makes the code rather slow for each photon package!} But one needs
fewer photon packages to get sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio. You
can experiment with fewer :math:`\phi` angles by adding, in ``radmc3d.inp``,
the following line (as an example)::

  dust_2daniso_nphi = 60

in which case instead of 360 the model will only use 60 :math:`\phi`
points. That will speed up the code significantly, but of course will treat the
:math:`\phi`-dependence of the scattering source function with lower precision.

For now the 2-D axisymmetric version of full scattering is only possible with
first-order integration.


.. _sec-photon-packages-mc:

More about photon packages in the Monte Carlo simulations
=========================================================

In the 'standard' Monte Carlo approach, the input energy (e.g. starlight or, for
the scattering Monte Carlo, the thermal emission of dust) is divided into
:math:`N` equal energy packages of photons, which then travel through the model
and eventually either escape or get destroyed. This equal division scheme is,
however, problematic for some model setups. For instance, if you have stars with
vastly different luminosity in the model, then the brightest of these stars will
dominate, by far, the number of output photon packages.  This means that the
material around low-brightness stars (which, by their proximity to these
low-brightness stars, are still dominated by heating by these low-brightness
stars) will experience very bad photon statistics.

To avoid this problem, RADMC-3D has, by default, its 'weighted photon package
mode' switched on. This will make sure that each source of energy (i.e. each
star, but also each other type of source) emits the same amount of
photons. Only: bright stars will emit more energetic photon packages than dim
stars.

The 'weighted photon package mode' will also solve another problem.  Suppose a
star lies far outside of the grid. It will emit most of its photons in
directions that completely miss the grid. This means that RADMC-3D would waste a
lot of time drawing random numbers for photons that will anyway not affect the
model. Also here the 'weighted photon package mode' solves the problem: It will
focus the photon packages toward the model grid, and lower their energy to
compensate for their favorable focusing toward the grid.

*NOTE:* You can switch the mode off by setting ``mc_weighted_photons=0`` in the
``radmc3d.inp`` file.


.. _sec-polarized-thermal-emission:

Polarized emission and absorption by aligned grains
===================================================

*NOTE: This mode is still in the testing phase*

Grain alignment and its effects on radiative transfer is a complex topic. A
review is e.g. Andersson, B.G., Lazarian, A., & Vaillancourt, J.E. (2015)
'Interstellar Dust Grain Alignment', Annual Review of Astronomy and
Astrophysics, 53(1), 501–539. In RADMC-3D grain alignment is included only in a
limited form. First and foremost: RADMC-3D does not know about the physics {\em
causing} the grain alignment. You, the user, will have to tell how the grain are
aligned by giving the code a directional vector field and for each wavelength
the degree to which the grain is aligned to that directional vector (more on
this later). This is according to the RADMC-3D philosophy of doing {\em only}
the radiative transfer and leaving the physics of the material to the user.

.. _sec-basic-equations:

Basics
------

Suppose we have flattened (oblate) ellipsoidal grains with one axis of symmetry
and no helicity. (While helicity may be needed to radiatively spin up grains, we
assume that on average the helicity of the grains is zero.). Let us assume that
they are aligned with that symmetry axis along the :math:`y`-axis. We view
radiation from the point where the :math:`z`-axis points toward us. Horizontally
polarized light (which has :math:`E`-field in horizontal direction, i.e. in
:math:`x`-direction) has :math:`Q/I=+1`, vertically polarized light (with the
:math:`\vec E` vector aligned with the symmetry axis of the grain) has
:math:`Q/I=-1`. We can then assume that the dust has different extinction
coefficients for the horizontal and vertical axis. Let us call these:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   \alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}} &\equiv \rho_d\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}\\
   \alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}} &\equiv \rho_d\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}}
   \end{split}

We can define :math:`I`, :math:`Q`, :math:`U` and :math:`V` in terms of the electric field
components :math:`E_x` and :math:`E_y`. The electric field components for a perfectly
coherent wave can be written as

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   E_x&=E_{x,0}\cos(\omega t-\Delta_x)\\
   E_y&=E_{y,0}\cos(\omega t-\Delta_y)
   \end{split}

where :math:`\Delta_x` and :math:`\Delta_y` are phase lags. The phase lag between
the :math:`y` and :math:`x`-fields is :math:`\Delta=\Delta_y-\Delta_x`, meaning that for
positive :math:`\Delta` the :math:`y`-field lags behind the :math:`x`-field. We then 
define the Stokes components as:

.. _eq-def-stokes-iquv:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   I &= E_{x,0}^2+E_{y,0}^2\\
   Q &= E_{x,0}^2-E_{y,0}^2\\
   U &= 2E_{x,0}E_{y,0}\cos\Delta\\
   V &= 2E_{x,0}E_{y,0}\sin\Delta
   \end{split}
   
Note that for :math:`V=I` (:math:`\Delta=\pi/2`, i.e. the :math:`E_y` lags
:math:`\pi/2` behind :math:`E_x`) we have *right-handed* circularly polarized
light, meaning that the tip of the :math:`\vec E` field at a fixed point in
space, when looking into the light (the propagation of light is toward the
reader) rotates counter-clockwise (when the :math:`x`-coordinate points right,
and the :math:`y`-coordinate points up). The 3-D helix of his field will be {\em
left-handed} (when the z-coordinate points into the propagation direction of the
light, i.e. toward the reader, i.e. a right-handed coordinate system). For
:math:`Q=I` we have linearly polarized light in which the :math:`\vec E`-field
lies in the :math:`x`-direction. For :math:`U=I` we have linearly polarized
light in which :math:`\vec E` lies along the :math:`x=y` line (when looking into
the light). These definitions are consistent with the IAU 1974 definitions
(Hamaker & Bregman 1996, A&AS 117, pp.161).

The :math:`E_x` and :math:`E_y` get absorbed in the following way:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   E_{x,0}' &= E_{x,0} e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}s}\\
   E_{y,0}' &= E_{y,0} e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}}s}
   \end{split}
   
where :math:`s` is a length along the ray.

For this kind of problem it is convenient to introduce the so-called *modified
Stokes parameters* :math:`I_{\mathrm{h}}` and :math:`I_{\mathrm{v}}`:

.. _eq-modif-stokes-hv:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} &= \frac{1}{2}(I+Q)\\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} &= \frac{1}{2}(I-Q)
   \end{split}
   
so that we have 

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   I &= I_{\mathrm{h}}+I_{\mathrm{v}}\\
   Q &= I_{\mathrm{h}}-I_{\mathrm{v}}
   \end{split}
   
so that one can say, for perfectly coherent light,

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} &= E_{x,0}^2\\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} &= E_{y,0}^2
   \end{split}
   
With this we get the following extinction law:

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   I_{\mathrm{h}}' &= I_{\mathrm{h}} e^{-\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}s}\\
   I_{\mathrm{v}}' &= I_{\mathrm{v}} e^{-\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}}s}
   \end{split}

How do :math:`U` and :math:`V` extinct? If we use Eqs. (:ref:`eq-def-stokes-u`,
:ref:`eq-def-stokes-v`), and assume that the phase lag :math:`\Delta` will not
change during the extinction, then 

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   U' &= U e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}s} e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}}s}\\
      &= U e^{-\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}+\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}})s}
   \end{split}

This means that 

.. math::

   \alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{uv}} =
   \frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}+\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}}\right)

and

.. math::
   
   \begin{split}
   I_{\mathrm{u}}' &= I_{\mathrm{u}} e^{-\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{uv}}s}\\
   I_{\mathrm{v}}' &= I_{\mathrm{v}} e^{-\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{uv}}s}
   \end{split}

In matrix notation

.. math::

   \frac{d}{ds}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} \\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   = - 
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \alpha_{\mathrm{h}} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{v}} & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & 0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{uv}} & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{uv}} \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} \\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)

If we translate this to the usual Stokes components we get

.. math::

   \frac{d}{ds}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I \\
   Q \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   = - 
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \alpha_1 & \alpha_2 & 0 & 0 \\
   \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & 0 & \alpha_1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_1 \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I \\
   Q \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)

with

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   \alpha_1 &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}+\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}}\right) 
   = \alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{uv}}\\
   \alpha_2 &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}}-\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}}\right) 
   \end{split}

The emission will be also independently in horizontal and vertical
direction. But nothing will be emitted in U or V direction. So it is most
convenient to express the emission/absorption process in terms of the
modified Stokes parameters:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   \frac{dI_{\nu,\mathrm{h}}}{ds} &= \alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{h}} (\frac{1}{2}B_\nu(T)-I_{\nu,\mathrm{h}}) \\
   \frac{dI_{\nu,\mathrm{v}}}{ds} &= \alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{v}} (\frac{1}{2}B_\nu(T)-I_{\nu,\mathrm{v}}) \\
   \frac{dU_{\nu}}{ds} &= -\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{uv}} U_{\nu} \\
   \frac{dV_{\nu}}{ds} &= -\alpha_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,\mathrm{uv}} V_{\nu}
   \end{split}
   
In terms of matrix notation this becomes

.. _eq-formal-rt-emisabs-in-rotated-system:

.. math::

   \frac{d}{ds}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} \\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   = \left(\begin{matrix}
   \tfrac{1}{2}\alpha_{\mathrm{h}} B_\nu(T) \\
   \tfrac{1}{2}\alpha_{\mathrm{v}} B_\nu(T) \\
   0 \\
   0 \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   - 
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \alpha_{\mathrm{h}} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{v}} & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & 0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{uv}} & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{uv}} \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} \\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)

In terms of the normal Stokes parameters this becomes

.. math::

   \frac{d}{ds}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I \\
   Q \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   = \left(\begin{matrix}
   \alpha_1 B_\nu(T) \\
   \alpha_2 B_\nu(T) \\
   0 \\
   0 \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   - 
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \alpha_1 & \alpha_2 & 0 & 0 \\
   \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & 0 & \alpha_1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_1 \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I \\
   Q \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)

or written slightly differently:

.. math::

   \frac{d}{ds}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I \\
   Q \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   =  
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \alpha_1 & \alpha_2 & 0 & 0 \\
   \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & 0 & \alpha_1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_1 \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left[
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   B_\nu(T) \\
   0 \\
   0 \\
   0 \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   -\left(\begin{matrix}
   I \\
   Q \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)\right]

So to sum things up: We need only the absorption opacity for light with
:math:`\vec E` perpencidular to the symmetry axis
(:math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,h}`) and the absorption opacity for light with
:math:`\vec E` parallel to the symmetry axis
(:math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,v}`).



Implementation in RADMC-3D
--------------------------

Polarized emission in the images and spectra
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating images (and spectra) the ``camera`` module of RADMC-3D
performs a ray-tracing calculation ('volume rendering') through the grid.
Normally (for randomly oriented grains) the extinction along the line of
sight is always unpolarized, i.e. each Stokes component is extincted
equally much. The thermal emission along the line of sight is also
unpolarized. 

Now, however, we wish to include the effect of grain alignment in the
ray-tracing. We assume that at position :math:`\vec x` in the grid our oblate
grain is aligned such that the minor axis points in the direction of the
orientation vector :math:`\vec n_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)`. If the grain is
prolate, we assume that it spins along one of its minor axes such that this
spin axis is pointing along :math:`\vec n_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)`, so that, in
effect, it acts as if it were an oblate grain again. In practice the
alignment vector :math:`\vec n_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)` does not lie always in
the plane of the sky of the observer. Instead it will have an angle :math:`\theta`
with the line-of-sight direction vector :math:`\vec n_{\mathrm{los}}` (note that
this :math:`\theta` angle is different from the scattering angle :math:`\theta`), 
defined as

.. math::

   \cos\theta \equiv = \left|\vec n_{\mathrm{align}}\cdot 
   \vec n_{\mathrm{los}}\right|

Here we assume that the grains have top/bottom symmetry so that we only have to
concern ourselves with the positive values of :math:`\cos\theta`, hence the
:math:`||`. If :math:`\cos\theta=1` then we see the oblate grain from the top or
the bottom, so that we do not expect any polarized emission. The strongest
polarized emission is expected when :math:`\cos\theta=0`, which means that the
oblate grain is seen edge-on.

We can now define the 'projected alignment vector' :math:`\vec
n_{\mathrm{align,proj}}`, which is the alignment vector projected into
the image plane:

.. math::

   \vec n_{\mathrm{align,proj}} = \vec n_{\mathrm{align}} - (\vec n_{\mathrm{align}}\cdot 
   \vec n_{\mathrm{los}})\;\vec n_{\mathrm{los}}

To use the equations from Section :ref:`sec-basic-equations` we must first
rotate our image plane coordinates :math:`(x,y)` to new coordinates :math:`(x',y')` such
that the :math:`y'` (vertical) direction points along the :math:`\vec
n_{\mathrm{align,proj}}` vector while the :math:`x'` (horizontal) direction points
perpendicular to it. Let us write the Stokes vector of the radiation along
the line of sight
:math:`(I_{\mathrm{in}},Q_{\mathrm{in}},U_{\mathrm{in}},V_{\mathrm{in}})`, where
we implicitly know that these are also a function of frequency :math:`\nu`. This
Stokes vector is defined with respect to the vector :math:`\vec S` which is
perpendicular to the line-of-sight direction vector :math:`\vec n_{\mathrm{los}}`
and defines the direction in which the :math:`y`-coordinate of the image plane
points. We must now express this incoming radiation (at the start of the
segment) in the new :math:`(x',y')` image plane coordinates, i.e. with respect to
the new vector :math:`\vec S'` that points along :math:`\vec n_{\mathrm{align,proj}}`
(i.e. :math:`\vec S'` is the normalized version of :math:`\vec
n_{\mathrm{align,proj}}`). This rotation is performed using

.. _eq-rot-stokes-align:

.. math::

   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I'\\Q'\\U'\\V'
   \end{matrix}\right)
   =
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \cos(2\alpha) & \sin(2\alpha) & 0 \\
   0 & -\sin(2\alpha) & \cos(2\alpha) & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I_{\mathrm{in}}\\Q_{\mathrm{in}}\\U_{\mathrm{in}}\\V_{\mathrm{in}}
   \end{matrix}\right)

where :math:`\alpha` is the angle between :math:`\vec S'` and :math:`\vec S`
such that if (as seen by the observer) :math:`\vec S'` lies counter-clockwise
from :math:`\vec S`, :math:`\alpha` is positive (the usual definition). With
this new Stokes vector :math:`(I',Q',U',V')` we will now use the equations of
Section :ref:`sec-basic-equations`.

To be able to perform this rotation in a uniquely defined way, it is necessary
that along each segment along the line of sight this new :math:`(x',y')`
orientation stays fixed (but can vary from segment to segment). As the
line-of-sight ray enters a cell and leaves it again, this line element (segment)
will have its image-plane coordinates rotated according to the alignment vector
of that cell. As a result, the integration must be done first order (assuming
all source terms to be constant along the segment).  In principle second order
integration would also be possible, but then the trick with the rotation of the
image coordinate plane such that :math:`y'` points along the orientation vector
does no longer work, and the integration of the formal transfer equation would
become much more complex, involving the full Müller matrix formulation. We will
not do this, so we will stick to first order integration of
Eq. :ref:`eq-formal-rt-emisabs-in-rotated-system`.

For convenience we will leave out the primes (') from here on, so while we write
:math:`(I,Q,U,V)` we mean in fact :math:`(I',Q',U',V')`. We now compute
:math:`I_{\mathrm{h}}` and :math:`I_{\mathrm{v}}` using
Eqs. (:ref:`eq-modif-stokes-h`, :ref:`eq-modif-stokes-v`). Now, along this
segment of the ray, we can write
Eq. :ref:`eq-formal-rt-emisabs-in-rotated-system` in the following form:

.. _eq-firstorder-int-emisabs:

.. math::

   \frac{d}{ds}
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} \\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   = 
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \alpha_{\mathrm{h}} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{v}} & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & 0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{uv}} & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_{\mathrm{uv}} \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   \left[
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   \tfrac{1}{2} B_\nu(T) \\
   \tfrac{1}{2} B_\nu(T) \\
   0 \\
   0 \\
   \end{matrix}\right)
   - 
   \left(\begin{matrix}
   I_{\mathrm{h}} \\
   I_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   U \\
   V \\
   \end{matrix}\right)\right]

It becomes clear that it is easy to perform the first order integration of this
equation along this ray segment:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   I_{\mathrm{h,end}} &=  e^{-\tau_h}I_{\mathrm{h,start}} + \tfrac{1}{2}e^{-\tau_h}B_\nu(T)\\
   I_{\mathrm{v,end}} &=  e^{-\tau_v}I_{\mathrm{v,start}} + \tfrac{1}{2}e^{-\tau_v}B_\nu(T) \\
   U_{\mathrm{end}} &=    e^{-\tau_{uv}}U_{\mathrm{start}}\\
   V_{\mathrm{end}} &=    e^{-\tau_{uv}}V_{\mathrm{start}}
   \end{split}
   
where 'start' stands for the start of the ray segment, and 'end' the end of the
ray segment (which becomes the start of the next ray segment), and
:math:`\tau_h=\alpha_{\mathrm{h}}\Delta s`,
:math:`\tau_v=\alpha_{\mathrm{v}}\Delta s` and
:math:`\tau_{uv}=\alpha_{\mathrm{uv}}\Delta s`, with :math:`\Delta s` being the
length of the segment.

We now compute :math:`I_{\mathrm{end}}` and :math:`Q_{\mathrm{end}}`, and rotate
back to the :math:`(x,y)` image plane coordinate system (i.e. using :math:`\vec
S` instead of :math:`\vec S'` to define the Stokes parameters) by applying
Eq. :ref:`eq-rot-stokes-align` but now with :math:`\alpha\rightarrow -\alpha`,
and we have the values of the Stokes parameter at the end of the ray
segment. Now we repeat this whole procedure for the next ray segment.


Polarized emission as source term in the Monte Carlo simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The polarization effects and anisotropic emission by aligned grains will
also affect the Monte Carlo simulations.

For the *thermal Monte Carlo* (see Section :ref:`sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo`)
this effect is *not included*. In principle it should be included, but it would
slow the code down, and it is unlikely to play a significant role for the dust
temperature, in particular since the anisotropy of thermal emission is not
expected to be so strong (and the polarization state is irrelevant for computing
the dust temperature). It is clear that we make a small error here, but we
believe that this is well within the much stronger uncertainties of the dust
opacities.

For the *scattering Monte Carlo* (see Section :ref:`sec-scat-monte-carlo`),
however, this effect may be important! The polarization caused by scattering of
light off dust grains yields of course different results if the incident light
is unpolarized or if it is already strongly polarized through, for instance,
polarized thermal emission. In RADMC-3D this is therefore built into the
scattering Monte Carlo. This will not slow down the code much because (in
contrast to the thermal Monte Carlo) the polarized thermal emission only has to
be computed at the start of each photon path, if the photon is emitted by the
dust.

The way this is included is that when a photon is emitted by the dust inside a
cell, RADMC-3D first randomly chooses which of the dust species emits the photon
(the probabilities are weighted by the contribution each dust species makes to
the emissivity at the given wavelength).  Then the emission direction is
randomly chosen, based on the :math:`\theta`-dependent probability function
(where :math:`\theta` is the angle with the alignment direction) given by the
average of the orthogonal (horizontal) and parallel (vertical) absorption
opacities. Once the emission direction is chosen, the polarization state of the
photon package is computed based on the orthogonal and parallel absorption
opacities. Then the photon package is sent on its way.

Note that if ``alignment_mode = -1`` then the polarized (and anisotropic)
thermal emission by aligned grains is only included in the ray-tracing for
images and spectra, while for ``alignment_mode = 1`` it is *also* included
in the scattering Monte Carlo computation.


Consistency with other radiative processes
------------------------------------------

The above equations assume that the absorption/emission is the only radiative
process included. However, in practice we also have other processes involved,
such as line emission/absorption or the scattering source function. The way this
can be treated here is to simply add these additional opacities to all four
components of the extinction matrix of
Eq. (:ref:`eq-formal-rt-emisabs-in-rotated-system`) and to add the additional
emissivities to the vector with the Planck functions in
Eq. (:ref:`eq-formal-rt-emisabs-in-rotated-system`). For the scattered light
emissivity (which is a Stokes vector) we must also first perform a rotation from
:math:`\vec S` to :math:`\vec S'` using the Stokes rotation formula of
Eq. (:ref:`eq-rot-stokes-align`) before we add this emissivity to the
equation. If we include the effect of alignment on the scattering (see Section
:ref:`sec-align-scat`) then also the scattering extinction will be different for
the orthogonal (horizontal) and parallel (vertical) Stokes components. That is
easy to include in this formalism.


Input files for RADMC-3D for aligned grains
-------------------------------------------

In RADMC-3D we implement the functions :math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,h}` and
:math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,v}` as a function of angle :math:`\theta` which the
alignment axis makes with the light of sight. For :math:`\theta` we see the oblate
grain from the top (face-on), so that there is no asymmetry between
horizontal (orthogonal to the alignment orientation vector) and vertical
(parallel to the alignment orientation vector). Then we will have
:math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,h}=\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,v}`. For
:math:`\theta=90^{\circ}` we will have the maximum difference between
:math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,h}` and :math:`\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,v}`. We write

.. _eq-align-kappa-k-hv:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,h}(\theta) &= \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu}\,k_{\nu,h}(\theta)\\
   \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,v}(\theta) &= \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu}\,k_{\nu,v}(\theta)
   \end{split}
   
where :math:`k_{\nu,h}(\theta)` and :math:`k_{\nu,v}(\theta)` are dimensionless
functions, and where we take :math:`\theta\in[0,90]` (in degrees), or
equivalently :math:`\cos(\theta)\in [0,1]`. We impose the condition that if we
randomly orient this grain, the average opacity becomes the one we computed for
the randomly oriented grains:

.. math::

   \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{2}\left[\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,h}(\theta)
   +\kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,v}(\theta)\right]d\mu = \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu}

This yields the following integration condition on the dimensionless
:math:`k_{\nu,h}` and :math:`k_{\nu,v}`:

.. math::

   \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{2}\left[k_{\nu,h}(\theta)+k_{\nu,v}(\theta)\right]d\mu = 1

If we set, for all values of :math:`\theta`,
:math:`k_{\nu,h}(\theta)=k_{\nu,v}(\theta)=1` then we retrieve the result for
spherical grains.

In RADMC-3D the functions :math:`k_{\nu,h}(\theta)` and :math:`k_{\nu,v}(\theta)`
are read in via the file ``dustkapalignfact_*.inp``. This file
has the following structure::

  # Any amount of arbitrary
  # comment lines that tell which opacity this is.
  # Each comment line must start with an # or ; or ! character
  iformat                            <=== Typically 1 at present
  nlam                               <=== Nr of wavelengths

  ...

  ...                                            
  k_orth[nmu,1]     k_para[nmu,1]               
  k_orth[1,2]       k_para[1,2]                 
  ...
  k_orth[nmu,2]     k_para[nmu,2]
  ...
  ...
  ...
  k_orth[1,nlam]    k_para[1,nlam]
  ...
  k_orth[nmu,nlam]  k_para[nmu,nlam]

The angles ``theta`` are in degrees and must start at 0 and end at 90, or vice
versa.  The ``nmu`` does not have to be the same (and the angles do not have to
be the same) as those in the ``dustkapscatmat_*.inp`` file. But the wavelength
grid must be identical to the one in the ``dustkapscatmat_*.inp`` file.

In order to make RADMC-3D read this file ``dustkapalignfact_*.inp`` the
``dustopac.inp`` file should, for this particular dust species, have '20' as the
way in which this dust species is read (instead of 10 which is used for
polarized scattering with the Z matrix).

In addition, RADMC-3D also needs to know the orientation direction of the
grains. This is a vector field :math:`\vec p_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)`. The
length of these vectors should be between 0 and 1, where 1 means that the grains
are perfectly aligned and 0 means they are not aligned at all. The efficiency
:math:`\epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}` is thus given by

.. math::

   \epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x) =|\vec p_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)|

The directional unit-vector of alignment :math:`\vec n_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)`
is thus

.. math::

   \vec n_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x) = \big(\epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)\big)^{-1}\vec p_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)

The :math:`\vec p_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)` vector field is in
the file ``grainalign_dir.inp`` (or its binary formatted version
``grainalign_dir.binp``). The format of this file is exactly the
same as that of the gas velocity file ``gas_velocity.inp``. The
ascii format looks like::

  iformat                                  <=== Typically 1 at present
  nrcells
  p_x[1]       p_y[1]       p_z[1]
  ..
  p_x[nrcells] p_y[nrcells] p_z[nrcells]

Note that :math:`|\vec p_{\mathrm{align}}(\vec x)|` should never be
:math:`>1`. If it is found to be significantly :math:`>1` at some point in the
grid, then an error occurs. If it is only a tiny bit above 1, due to rounding
errors, it will be normalized to 1.

The way in which partial alignment (:math:`0<\epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}<1`) is
treated in RADMC-3D is to treat the opacities and emissivities as simple
linear sums of fully aligned and non aligned versions. For instance,
Eqs. (:ref:`eq-align-kappa-k-h`, :ref:`eq-align-kappa-k-v`) then become

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,h}(\theta) &= \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu}\,[\epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}k_{\nu,h}(\theta)+1-\epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}] \\
   \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu,v}(\theta) &= \kappa_{\mathrm{abs},\nu}\,[\epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}k_{\nu,v}(\theta)+1-\epsilon_{\mathrm{align}}] 
   \end{split}

In order to tell RADMC-3D that it should include the effect of alignment on the
thermal emission of dust grains one must add a line in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file
with::

  alignment_mode = 1

The example model in ``examples/run_simple_1_align/`` demonstrates how the input
files have to be made to have RADMC-3D treat the aligned dust grains for thermal
emission.

Grain size distributions
========================

.. _sec-grain-size-distributions-overview:

Quick summary of how to implement grain sizes
---------------------------------------------

A common application of RADMC-3D is continuum radiative transfer in media with a
grain size distribution. RADMC-3D does not know the concept of "grain size
distribution", and it does not care. You have to provide RADMC-3D will all the
information it needs, such that it will handle the dust size distribution you
want. All the responsibility lies with you, the user. 

There are basically two ways by which you can make RADMC-3D treat a grain size
distribution:

* Method 1: Mixing the dust opacities into a single opacity file, having
  RADMC-3D think that there is only one dust species. Fast and simple.

* Method 2: Computing :math:`N` dust opacity files, having :math:`N` independent
  dust species. Slower but more realistic and flexible.

In the following subsections we will discuss both methods. 
  
.. _sec-grain-size-distributions-method-1:

Method 1: Size distribution in the opacity file (faster)
--------------------------------------------------------
  
The simplest way is to compute a single dust opacity table (see Section
:ref:`sec-opacities`) for a single dust species. You compute the weighted dust
opacity and put that into the file ``dustkappa_XXX.inp`` (for instance let's
call it ``dustkappa_sizedistrib.inp``) or ``dustkapscatmat_XXX.inp`` (for
instance let's call it ``dustkapscatmat_sizedistrib.inp``).  All the information
about the size distribution shape is then encoded in this opacity file, and
RADMC-3D will never know that it is, in fact, a size distribution. The file
``dust_density.inp`` will then only contain the spatial distribution of a single
grain species: that of the mixture of sizes. Advantage: it is the
easiest. Disadvantage: the size distribution will be identical
everywhere. Another disadvantage: each grain size will have the same temperature
(because RADMC-3D does not know that these are different dust sizes).

This method be useful to save computer time. You essentially do all the work of
computing the opacity of the size distribution beforehand (even before you start
RADMC-3D), so that you get a single opacity file that already contains the
size-distribution-weighted opacities. You must then be sure that you do the
weighting such that the opacity is "cross section per gram of dust", where
"dust" is already the entire grain size distribution. The dust density in the
``dust_density.inp`` file must then also be the density of the entire grain size
distribution. See Section :ref:`sec-math-of-grain-size-distributions` for more
information about size distributions.

.. _sec-grain-size-distributions-method-2:
  
Method 2: Size distribution in the density file (better)
--------------------------------------------------------

RADMC-3D can handle multiple dust species simultaneously and co-spatially. So
you can have :math:`N` grain sizes, each represented by its own opacity file and
its own spatial density distribution. So if we, for example, have two sizes, 1
micron and 1 millimeter (i.e. :math:`N=2`) then we would have, for instance, two
opacity files, ``dustkappa_1micron.inp`` and ``dustkappa_1mm.inp`` (don't forget
to mark them both in ``dustopac.inp`` too), and within the ``dust_density.inp``
file we have two density fields. This allows you, for instance, to have the
large grains near the midplane of a disk and the small grains vertically more
extended, because you can determine the density :math:`\rho` of each dust
species completely independent from the others.

We have now two choices how to handle these species: (a) thermally coupled (set
``itempdecoup = 0`` in ``radmc3d.inp``, see section :ref:`sec-radmc-inp`, or (b)
thermally decoupled (default, but you can set ``itempdecoup = 1`` in
``radmc3d.inp`` to make sure). The default is thermally decoupled, because that
is for most cases more realistic. If the grains are thermally decoupled, then,
in the optically thin regions exposed to hot stellar radiation, the small grains
tend to be hotter than the large ones. However, in optically thick regions the
small and large grains will tend to automatically acquire similar or the same
temperature(s).

Compared to the first method (with a single dust species), this method is more
flexible (allowing different spatial distributions for different grain sizes)
but also more costly (requiring the radiative transfer code to handle the
interaction of the radiation with :math:`N` independent dust species). You must
then calculate each grain opacity file separately, and keep these normalized to
"cross section per gram of this particular dust species or size". Here, the
weighting is not done in the opacity files, but in the fact that each grain size
(or species) :math:`i` has its own density :math:`\rho_i`. You would then need
to make sure that these :math:`\rho_i` are following the size distribution you
wish. See Section :ref:`sec-math-of-grain-size-distributions` for more
information about size distributions.

.. _sec-math-of-grain-size-distributions:

The mathematics of grain size distributions
-------------------------------------------

Grain size distributions can be confusing, so here is a small tutorial.
Suppose we have the famous MRN (Mathis, Rumpl, Nordsieck) size distribution:

.. math::

   n(a)da \propto a^{-7/2}da

with :math:`a` the radius of the grain, :math:`n(a)da` the number of grains
between sizes :math:`a` and :math:`a+da` per volume. We say that this
powerlaw goes from :math:`a=a_{\mathrm{min}}` to :math:`a=a_{\mathrm{max}}`,
and we keep in mind that :math:`a_{\mathrm{max}}` can be (but does not
have to) orders of magnitude larger than :math:`a_{\mathrm{min}}`. 
The total dust density :math:`\rho` is:

.. math::

   \rho = \int_{a_{\mathrm{min}}}^{a_{\mathrm{max}}} m(a)n(a)da

where :math:`m(a)` is the mass of the grain:

.. math::

   m(a) = \rho_s \frac{4\pi}{3}a^3

where :math:`\rho_s` is the material density of the grain material (typically
somewhere between 1 and 3.6 :math:`\mathrm{gram}/\mathrm{cm}^3`, dependent on the material).

For RADMC-3D we have to disretize this into :math:`N` bins. Since we can have
:math:`a_{\mathrm{max}}\gg a_{\mathrm{min}}`, it is best to take a logarithmic
grid in :math:`a`, i.e. equal spacing in :math:`\ln(a)`.  So we divide the
interval :math:`[\ln(a_{\mathrm{min}}),\ln(a_{\mathrm{max}})]` up into :math:`N`
equal size bins, numbering :math:`i=0` to :math:`i=N-1`, with cell centers
denoted as :math:`\ln(a_i)` and the cell walls are denoted as
:math:`\ln(a_{i-1/2})` for the left- and :math:`\ln(a_{i+1/2})` for the
right-hand cell wall. We have :math:`\ln(a_{-1/2})=\ln(a_{\mathrm{min}})` and
:math:`\ln(a_{N-1/2})=\ln(a_{\mathrm{max}})`. For any :math:`i` we have the same
cell width in log-space:
:math:`\Delta\ln(a)=\Delta\ln(a_i)=\ln(a_{i+1/2})-\ln(a_{i-1/2})`.
Now the density for each bin is:

.. math::

   \rho_i = \int_{a_{i-1/2}}^{a_{i+1/2}} m(a)\,n(a)\,da = \int_{\ln(a_{i-1/2})}^{\ln(a_{i+1/2})} a\,m(a)\,n(a)\,d\ln(a)

If the bin width :math:`\Delta\ln(a)` is small enough, this can be approximated
as

.. math::

   \rho_i \simeq a_i m(a_i)n(a_i)\Delta\ln(a)

The total dust density is then

.. math::

   \rho = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \rho_i 
   
The opacity for bin :math:`i` at some frequency :math:`\nu` is approximately :math:`\kappa_\nu(a_i)`
if a small enough bin size is used. That means that the extinction coefficient

.. math::

   \alpha_\nu = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \rho_i\kappa_\nu(a_i) 

In method 2 (Section :ref:`sec-grain-size-distributions-method-2`) this is exactly what happens:
you specify :math:`N` tables of :math:`\kappa_\nu(a_i)` (each table containing all frequencies
for which you want to use the opacity), and the "mixing" happens in each grid cell on-the-fly
depending on the local values of :math:`\rho_i`. The values of :math:`\rho_i` in the file
``dust_density.inp`` are exactly these :math:`\rho_i`.

On the contrary, in method 1 (Section :ref:`sec-grain-size-distributions-method-1`), you compute
a nomalized :math:`\hat n(a_i)` such that 

.. math::

   \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}  a_i m(a_i)\hat n(a_i)\Delta\ln(a) = 1

so that with 

.. math::

   \hat\rho_i \simeq a_i m(a_i)\hat n(a_i)\Delta\ln(a)

we get

.. math::
   
   \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}  \hat\rho_i = 1

Now we can compute a grain-size-mean opacity:

.. math::

   \hat\kappa_\nu = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \hat\rho_i\kappa_\nu(a_i)

which is computed before running RADMC-3D, and will be valid at all locations in the spatial grid.
At each cell we only have the total dust density :math:`\rho`. The extinction coefficient is
then

.. math::

   \alpha_\nu = \rho\hat\kappa_\nu
