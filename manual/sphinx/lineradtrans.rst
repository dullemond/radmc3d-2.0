Line radiative transfer
***********************

RADMC-3D is capable of modeling radiative transfer in molecular and/or
atomic lines. Due to the complexity of line radiative transfer, and the huge
computational and memory requirements of full-scale non-LTE line transfer,
RADMC-3D has various different modes of line transfer. Some modes are very
memory efficient, but slower, while others are faster, but less memory
efficient, yet others are more accurate but much slower and memory
demanding. The default mode (and certainly recommended initially) is LTE
ray-tracing in the slow but memory efficient way: the *simple LTE mode*
(see Section :ref:`sec-line-trans-modes`). Since this is the default mode,
you do not need to specify anything to have this selected.



Quick start for adding line transfer to images and spectra
==========================================================

Do properly model line transfer requires dedication and experimentation.
This is *not* a simple task. See Section :ref:`sec-lines-pitfalls` for an
analysis of several pitfalls one may encounter. However, nothing is better
than experimenting and thus gaining hands-on experience. So the easiest and
quickest way to start is to start with one of the simple line transfer test
models in the ``examples/`` directory. 

So simply visit ``examples/run_test_lines_1/``, ``examples/run_test_lines_2/``
or ``examples/run_test_lines_3/`` and follow the directions in the ``README`` file.
The main features of adding line ray tracing to a model is
to add the following files into any previously constructed model with dust
radiative transfer:

* ``lines.inp``: A control file for line transfer. 
* ``molecule_co.inp``: or any other molecular data file
  containing properties of the molecule or atom.
* ``numberdens_co.inp`` (or its binary version, see Chapter
  :ref:`chap-binary-io`) or that of another molecule: The number density of
  that molecule in units of :math:`\mathrm{cm}^{-3}`.
* ``gas_temperature.inp`` (or its binary version, see Chapter
  :ref:`chap-binary-io`): The gas temperature at each grid cell. You do not
  need to specify this file if you add the keyword ``tgas_eq_tdust = 1``
  into the ``radmc3d.inp`` file.


.. _sec-line-trans-definitions:

Some definitions for line transfer
==================================

The formal transfer equation is:

.. math::

   \frac{dI_\nu(\omega)}{ds} = j_\nu(\omega) - \alpha_\nu(\omega)I_\nu(\omega)

which is true also for the lines. Here :math:`\omega` is the direction,
:math:`\nu` the frequency, :math:`I` the intensity.  The emissivity
:math:`j_\nu` and extinction :math:`\alpha_\nu` for each line (given by
:math:`i` =upper level and :math:`j` =lower level) is given by:

.. _eq-molec-emis-def:

.. _eq-molec-extinct-def:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   j_{ij}(\Omega,\nu) &= \frac{h\nu}{4\pi}Nn_iA_{ij}
   \varphi_{ij}(\omega,\nu) \\
   \alpha_{ij}(\omega,\nu) &= \frac{h\nu}{4\pi}N(n_jB_{ji}-n_iB_{ij})
   \varphi_{ij}(\omega,\nu)
   \end{split}

Here :math:`N` is the number density of the molecule, :math:`n_i` is the *fraction* of the molecules that are in level :math:`i`, :math:`A_{ij}` is the
Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission from level :math:`i` to level
:math:`j`, and :math:`B_{ij}` and :math:`B_{ji}` are the Einstein-B-coefficients which obey:

.. math::

   A_{ij}     = \frac{2h\nu_{ij}^3}{c^2} B_{ij}, 
   B_{ji}g_j  = B_{ij} g_i 

where :math:`g` are the statistical weights of the levels, :math:`h` the Planck constant
and :math:`c` the light speed. The symbol :math:`\varphi_{ij}(\omega,\nu)` is the line
profile function. For zero velocity field
:math:`\varphi_{ij}(\omega,\nu)=\tilde\varphi_{ij}(\nu)`, i.e. the line profile
function is independent of direction. The tilde is to say that this is
the comoving line profile. It is given by

.. math::

   \tilde\varphi_{ij}(\nu) = \frac{c}{a_{\mathrm{tot}}\nu_{ij}\sqrt{\pi}} 
   \exp\left(-\frac{c^2(\nu-\nu_{ij})^2}{a_{\mathrm{tot}}^2\nu_{ij}^2}\right)

where :math:`\nu_{ij}` is the line-center frequency for the line and 
:math:`a_{\mathrm{tot}}` is the line width in units of cm/s. For pure
thermal broadning we have

.. math::

   a_{\mathrm{tot}}=a_{\mathrm{therm}}=\sqrt{\frac{2kT_{\mathrm{gas}}}{m_{\mathrm{mol}}}}

where :math:`m_{\mathrm{mol}}` is the weight of the molecule in gram, :math:`k` is the
Boltzmann constant, :math:`T_{\mathrm{gas}}` the gas temperature in K. As we shall
discuss in Section :ref:`sec-turb-broadening`: we can also add
'microturbulent line broadning' :math:`a_{\mathrm{turb}}`, also in cm/s:

.. math::

   a_{\mathrm{tot}}=\sqrt{a^2_{\mathrm{turb}}+a^2_{\mathrm{therm}}}=
   \sqrt{a^2_{\mathrm{turb}}+\frac{2kT_{\mathrm{gas}}}{m_{\mathrm{mol}}}}

When we have macroscopic velocities in our model, then the line profile
becomes angle-dependent (at a given lab-frame frequency):

.. math::

   \varphi_{ij}(\omega,\nu) = \tilde\varphi_{ij}\big(\nu(1-\vec\omega\cdot \vec v/c)-\nu_{ij}\big)

The radiative transfer equation for non overlapping lines is then

.. _eq-molec-rad-trans-eq:

.. math::

   \frac{dI_{ij}(\omega,\nu)}{ds} = j_{ij}(\omega,\nu) - 
   \alpha_{ij}(\omega,\nu) I_{ij}(\omega,\nu)\,.

But RADMC-3D naturally includes overlapping lines, at least in the 
ray-tracing (for spectra and images). For non-LTE modes the line
overlapping is not yet (as of December 2011) included.


.. _sec-line-trans-modes:

Line transfer modes and how to activate the line transfer
=========================================================

Line transfer can be done in various different ways. This is controlled by the
global variable ``lines_mode`` (see below) and by the nature of the
molecular/atomic data (see discussion in Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp`).

Two different atomic/molecular data file types
----------------------------------------------

Let us start with the latter: RADMC-3D does not have any atomic or molecular
data hard-coded inside. It reads these data from data files that you provide.
There are two fundamentally different ways to feed atomic/molecular data into
RADMC-3D:

* Files containing the full level and line information (named ``molecule_XXX.inp``, where ``XXX`` is the name of the molecule or
  atom). Atoms or molecules for which this data is provided can be treated
  in LTE as well as in non-LTE.
* Files containing only a line list (named ``linelist_XXX.inp``, where ``XXX`` is the name of the molecule or
  atom). Atoms or molecules for which this data is provided can only be
  treated in LTE.

.. _sec-lines-mode:

The different line modes (the ``lines_mode parameter``)
-------------------------------------------------------

For the atoms or molecules for which the full data are specified (the
``molecule_XXX.inp`` files) RADMC-3D has various different line
transfer modes, including different treatments of LTE or non-LTE. Which of
the modes you want RADMC-3D to use can be specified in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file by setting the variable ``lines_mode``, for
instance, by adding the following line to ``radmc3d.inp``::

  lines_mode = 3

for LVG + Escape Probability populations. If no option is given, then the *LTE mode* 
(``lines_mode=1``) is used. 

The various line modes are:

* *LTE mode (=default mode):* [``lines_mode=1``]
  
  In this mode the line radiative transfer is done under LTE assumptions.
  
* *User-defined populations:* [``lines_mode=2``]
  
  This calls the routine ``userdef_compute_levelpop()`` to compute
  the level populations. This allows the user to specify the populations of
  the levels of the molecules freely.
  
* *Large Velocity Gradient (Sobolev) populations:* [``lines_mode=3``]
  
  This is one of the non-LTE modes of RADMC-3D. This mode calculates the
  angle-averaged velocity gradient, and uses this to compute the level
  populations according to the Large Velocity Gradient method (also often
  called Sobolev's method). This method is like an escape probability
  method, where the escape probability is calculated based on the velocity
  gradient. For this mode to work, the velocity field has to be read in, as
  well as at least one of the number densities of the collision partners of
  the molecule. See Section :ref:`sec-lvg`.
  
* *Optically Thin non-LTE level populations method:* [``lines_mode=4``]
  
  This is one of the non-LTE modes of RADMC-3D. This mode calculates the
  non-LTE level populations under the assumption that all emitted line
  radiation escapes and is not reabsorbed. For this mode to work, at least
  one of the number densities of the collision partners of the molecule. See
  Section :ref:`sec-optthinpop`.
  
* *User-defined populations:* [``lines_mode=-10``]
  
  This calls the routine ``userdef_general_compute_levelpop()``
  on-the-fly during the ray-tracing. This is very much like
  ``userdef_compute_levelpop()``, except that it leaves the
  entire line-related stuff to the user: It does not read the molecular
  data from a file. NOTE: This is a rather tricky mode, to be used only
  if you know very well what you are doing...
  
* *Full non-LTE modes:* {\bf Not yet ready}

The default of the ``lines_mode`` variable is ``lines_mode=1``. 

**NOTE 1:** Line emission is automatically included in the images and spectra if
RADMC-3D finds the file ``lines.inp`` in the model directory. You can switch off
the lines with the command-line option ``'noline'``.

**NOTE 2:** If you are very limited by memory, and if you use LTE, LVG+EscProb
or optically thin populations, you can also ask RADMC-3D to *not* precalculate
the level populations before the rendering, but instead compute them
on-the-fly. This makes the code slower, but requires less memory.  You can do
this by choosing e.g. ``lines_mode=-3`` instead of ``lines_mode=3`` (for
LVG+EscProb).

The various input files for line transfer
=========================================

.. _sec-line-radmc-inp:

INPUT: The line transfer entries in the radmc3d.inp file
--------------------------------------------------------

Like all other modules of ``radmc3d``, also the line module
can be steered through keywords in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file.
Here is a list:

* ``tgas_eq_tdust`` (default: 0)
  
  Normally you must specify the gas temperature at each grid cell using the
  ``gas_temperature.inp`` file (or directly in the ``userdef_module.f90``, see
  Chapter :ref:`chap-internal-setup`). But sometimes you may want to compute
  first the dust temperature and then set the gas temperature equal to the dust
  temperature. You can do this obviously by hand: read the output dust
  temperature and create the equivalent gas temperature input file from it. But
  that is cumbersome.  By setting ``tgas_eq_tdust=1`` you tell ``radmc3d`` to
  simply read the ``dust_temperature.inp`` file and then equate the gas
  temperature to the dust temperature. If multiple dust species are present,
  only the first species will be used.


.. _sec-line-dot-inp:

INPUT: The line.inp file
------------------------

Like with the dust (which has this ``dustopac.inp`` master file,
also the line module has a master file: ``lines.inp``. It specifies
which molecules/atoms are to be modeled and in which file the
molecular/atomic data (such as the energy levels and the Einstein :math:`A`
coefficients) are to be found ::

  iformat                                  <=== Put this to 2
  N                                        Nr of molecular or atomic species to be modeled
  molname1 inpstyle1 iduma1 idumb1 ncol1   Which molecule used as species 1 + other info
  .
  .
  .
  molnameN inpstyleN idumaN idumbN ncolN   Which molecule used as species N + other info

The ``N`` is the number of molecular or atomic species you wish to
model. Typically this is 1. But if you want to *simultaneously* model for
instance the ortho-H\ :sub:`2`\ O and para-H\ :sub:`2`\ O infrared lines, you would
need to set this to 2.

The N lines following N (i.e. lines 3 to N+2) specify the molecule or atom, the
kind of input file format (explained below), and two integers which, at least
for now, can be simply set to 0 (see Section :ref:`sec-line-selection` for the
meaning of these integers - for experts only), plus finally third integer, which
has to do with non-LTE transfer: the number of collision partners (set to 0 if
you only intend to do LTE transfer).

The molecule name can be e.g. ``co`` for carbon monoxide. The file
containing the data should then be called ``molecule_co.inp`` (even
if it is an atom rather than a molecule; I could not find a good name which
means both molecule or atom). This file should be either generated by the
user, or (which is obviously the preferred option) taken from one of the
databases of molecular/atomic radiative properties. Since there are a number
of such databases and I want the code to be able to read those files without
the need of casting them into some special RADMC-3D format, ``radmc3d`` allows the user to select which *kind* of file
the ``molecule_co.inp`` (for CO) file is. At present only one
format is supported: the Leiden database. But more will follow. To 
specify to ``radmc3d`` to use the Leiden style, you put the
``inpstyle`` to 'leiden'. So here is a typical example of a
``lines.inp`` file::

  2
  1
  co   leiden   0   0   0 

This means: one molecule will be modeled, namely CO (and thus read from the file
``molecule_co.inp``), and the data format is the Leiden database format.

NOTE: Since version 0.26 the file format number of this file ``lines.inp``
has increased. It is now 2, because in each line an extra integer is added.

NOTE: The files from the Leiden LAMDA database (see Section
:ref:`sec-leiden-format`) are usually called something like ``co.dat``. You will
have to simply rename to ``molecule_co.inp``.

Most molecular data files have, in addition to the levels and radiative
rates, also the collision rates listed. See Section :ref:`sec-leiden-format`.
For non-LTE radiative transfer this is essential information. The number
densities of the collision partners (the particles with which the molecule
can collide and which can collisionally excited or de-excite the molecule)
are given in number density files with the same format as those of the
molecule itself (see Section :ref:`sec-collpartner`). However, we must tell
RADMC-3D to which collision partner particle the rate tables listed in the
``molecule_co.inp`` are associated (see Section
:ref:`sec-collpartner` for a better explanation of the issue here). This can
be done with the last of the integers in each line. Example: if the
``lines.inp`` file reads::

  2
  1
  co   leiden   0   0   2
  p-h2
  o-h2

this means that the first collision rate table (starting with the number
``3.2e-11`` in the example of Section :ref:`sec-leiden-format`) is for
collisions with particles for which the number density is given in the file
``numberdens_p-h2.inp`` and the second collision rate table (starting with the
number ``4.1e-11`` in the example of Section :ref:`sec-leiden-format`) is for
collisions with particles for which the number density is given in the file
``numberdens_o-h2.inp``.

We could also decide to ignore the difference between para-H\ :math:`_2` and
ortho-H\ :math:`_2`, and simply use the first table (starting with the number
``3.2e-11`` in the example of Section :ref:`sec-leiden-format`),
which is actually for para-H\ :math:`_2` only, as a proxy for the overall mixture
of H\ :math:`_2` molecules. After all: The collision rate for para-H\ :math:`_2` and
ortho-H\ :math:`_2` are not so very different. In that case we may simply ignore
this difference and only provide a file ``numberdens_h2.inp``,
and link that to the first of the two collision rate tables::

  2
  1
  co   leiden   0   0   1
  h2

(Note: we cannot, in this way, link this to the second of the two tables,
only to the first). But if we would do this::

  2
  1
  co   leiden   0   0   3
  p-h2
  o-h2
  h

we would get an error, because only two collision rate tables are
provided in ``molecule_co.inp``.

Finally, as we will explain in Section :ref:`sec-linelist-xxx-inp`, there
is an alternative way to feed atomic/molecular data into RADMC-3D: By using
linelists. To tell RADMC-3D to read a linelist file instead of a Leiden-style
molecular/atomic data file, just write the following in the ``lines.inp``
file::

  2
  1
  h2o  linelist 0   0   0

(example here is for water). This will make RADMC-3D read the
``linelist_h2o.inp`` file as a linelist file (see Section
:ref:`sec-linelist-xxx-inp`). Note that lines from a linelist will always be in
LTE.

You can also have multiple species, for which some are of Leiden-style and some
are linelist style. For instance::

  2
  2
  co   leiden   0   0   2
  p-h2
  o-h2
  h2o  linelist 0   0   0

Here the CO lines can be treated in a non-LTE manner (depending on what you put
for ``lines_mode``, see Section :ref:`sec-line-trans-modes`), and the
H\ :sub:`2`\ O is treated in LTE.


.. _sec-molecule-xxx-inp:
.. _sec-leiden-format:

INPUT: Molecular/atomic data: The molecule_XXX.inp file(s)
----------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned in Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp` the atomic or molecular
fundamental data such as the level diagram and the radiative decay rates
(Einstein A coefficients) are read from a file (or more than one files) named
``molecule_XXX.inp``, where the ``XXX`` is to be replaced by the name of the
molecule or atom in question. For these files RADMC-3D uses the Leiden LAMDA
database format. Note that, instead of a ``molecule_XXX.inp`` file you can also
give a linelist file, but this will be discussed in Section
:ref:`sec-linelist-xxx-inp`.

The precise format of the Leiden database data files is of course described
in detail on their web
page http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/ . Here we only
give a very brief overview, based on an example of CO in which only the
first few levels are specified (taken from the LAMDA database)::

      4    23.069512649	 7.0	 3

      2     3     2   6.910e-07     230.5380000     16.60

      4     5     4   6.126e-06     461.0407682     55.32

The first few lines are self-explanatory. The first of the two tables is about
the levels. Column one is simply a numbering. Column 2 is the energy of the
level :math:`E_k`, specified in units of :math:`1/\mathrm{cm}`. To get the energy in erg
you multiply this number with :math:`hc/k` where :math:`h` is the Planck
constant, :math:`c` the light speed and :math:`k` the Boltzmann constant. Column
3 is the degeneration number, i.e. the the :math:`g` parameter of the
level. Column 4 is redundant information, not used by the code.

The second table is the line list. Column 1 is again a simple counter.  Column 2
and 3 specify which two levels the line connects. Column 4 is the radiative
decay rate in units of :math:`1/\mathrm{s}`, i.e. the Einstein :math:`A`
coefficient. The last two columns are redundant information that can be easily
derived from the other information.

If you are interested in LTE line transfer, this is enough information.
However, if you want to use one of the non-LTE modes of RADMC-3D, you must
also have the collisional rate data. An example of a ``molecule_XXX.inp``
file that also contains these data is::

As you see, the first part is the same. Now, however, there is extra
information.  First, the number of collision partners, for which these
collisional rate data is specified, is given. Then follows the reference to the
paper containing these data (this is not used by RADMC-3D; it is just for
information). Then the number of collisional transitions that are tabulated
(since collisions can relate any level to any other level, this number should
ideally be ``nlevels*(nlevels-1)/2``, but this is not strictly enforced). Then
the number of temperature points at which these collisional rates are
tabulated. Then follows this list of temperatures.  Finally we have the table of
collisional transitions. Each line consists of, first, the ID of the transition
(dummy), then the upper level, then the lower level, and then the
:math:`K_{\mathrm{up,low}}` collisional rates in units of [:math:`\mathrm{cm}^3/s`]. The
same is again repeated (because in this example we have two collision partners:
the para-H\ :math:`_2` molecule and the ortho-H\ :math:`_2` molecule).

To get the collision rate :math:`C_{\mathrm{up,low}}` per molecule (in units of
[1/s]) for the molecule of interest, we must multiply
:math:`K_{\mathrm{up,low}}` with the number density of the collision partner
(see Section :ref:`sec-collpartner`).  So in this example, the
:math:`C_{\mathrm{up,low}}` becomes:

.. math::

   C_{\mathrm{up,low}} = N_{\mathrm{p-H}_2}K^{\mathrm{p-H}_2}_{\mathrm{up,low}}
   + N_{\mathrm{o-H}_2}K^{\mathrm{o-H}_2}_{\mathrm{up,low}}

The rates tabulated in this file are always the *downward* collision rate. The
upward rate is internally computed by RADMC-3D using the following formula:

.. math::

   C_{\mathrm{low,up}} = C_{\mathrm{up,low}} \frac{g_{\mathrm{up}}}{g_{\mathrm{low}}}
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)

where the :math:`g` factors are the statistical weights of the levels,
:math:`\Delta E` is the energy difference between the levels, :math:`k` is the
Boltzmann constant and :math:`T` the gas temperature.

Some notes:

* When doing LTE transfer *and* you make RADMC-3D read a separate
  file with the partition function (Section :ref:`sec-partition-function`),
  you can limit the ``molecule_XXX.inp`` files to just the levels
  and lines you are interested in. But again: You *must* then read the
  partition function separately, and not let RADMC-3D compute it internally
  based on the ``molecule_XXX.inp`` file.
* When doing non-LTE transfer and/or when you let RADMC-3D compute the
  partition function internally you *must* make sure to include all
  possible levels that might get populated, otherwise you may overpredict
  the strength of the lines you are interested in.
* The association of each of the collision partners in this file to
  files that contain their spatial distribution is a bit complicated. See
  Section :ref:`sec-collpartner`.


.. _sec-linelist-xxx-inp:

INPUT: Molecular/atomic data: The linelist_XXX.inp file(s)
----------------------------------------------------------

In many cases molecular data are merely given as lists of lines (e.g. the
HITRAN database, the Kurucz database, the Jorgensen et al. databases
etc.). These line lists contain information about the line wavelength
:math:`\lambda_0`, the line strength :math:`A_{\mathrm{ud}}`, the statistical
weights of the lower and upper level and the energy of the lower or upper
level. Sometimes also the name or set of quantum numbers of the levels, or
additional information about the line profile shapes are specified. These line
lists contain no *direct* information about the level diagram, although this
information can be extracted from the line list (if it is complete). These lines
lists also do not contain any information about collisional (de-)excitation, so
they cannot be used for non-LTE line transfer of any kind. They only work for
LTE line transfer. But such line lists are nevertheless used often (and thus LTE
is then assumed).

RADMC-3D can read the molecular data in line-list-form (files named
``linelist_XXX.inp``). RADMC-3D can in fact use both formats mixed (the line
list one and the 'normal' one of Section :ref:`sec-molecule-xxx-inp`). Some
molecules may be specified as line lists (``linelist_XXX.inp``) while
simultaneously others as full molecular files (``molecule_XXX.inp``, see Section
:ref:`sec-molecule-xxx-inp`).  For the 'linelist molecules' RADMC-3D will then
automatically use LTE, while for the other molecules RADMC-3D will use the mode
according to the ``lines_mode`` value. This means that you can use this to have
mixed LTE and non-LTE species of molecules/atoms within the same model, as long
as the LTE ones have their molecular/atomic data given in a line list form. This
can be useful to model situations where most of the lines are in LTE, but one
(or a few) are non-LTE.

Now coming back to the linelist data. Here is an example of such a file
(created from data from the HITRAN database)::

The file is pretty self-explanatory. It contains a table for the partition
function (necessary for LTE transfer) and a table with all the lines (or any
subset you wish to select). The lines table columns are as follows: first column
is just a dummy index. Second column is the wavelength in micron. Third is the
Einstein-A-coefficient (spontaneous downward rate) in units of
:math:`\mathrm{s}^{-1}`. Fourth and fifth are the energies above the ground state of
the lower and upper levels belonging to this line in units of
:math:`\mathrm{cm}^{-1}`. Sixth and seventh are the statistical weights (degenracies) of
the lower and upper levels belonging to this line.

Note that you can tell RADMC-3D to read ``linelist_h2o.inp`` (instead of search
for ``molecule_h2o.inp``) by specifying ``linelist`` instead of ``leiden`` in
the ``lines.inp`` file (see Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp`).


.. _sec-mol-numdensity:

INPUT: The number density of each molecular species
---------------------------------------------------

For the line radiative transfer we need to know how many molecules of each
species are there per cubic centimeter. For molecular/atom species ``XXX`` this
is given in the file ``numberdens_XXX.inp`` (see Chapter :ref:`chap-binary-io`
for the binary version of this file, which is more compact, and which you can
use instead of the ascii version). For each molecular/atomic species listed in
the ``lines.inp`` file there must be a corresponding ``numberdens_XXX.inp``
file. The structure of the file is very similar (though not identical) to the
structure of the dust density input file ``dust_density.inp`` (Section
:ref:`sec-dustdens`). For the precise way to address the various cells in the
different AMR modes, we refer to Section :ref:`sec-dustdens`, where this is
described in detail.

For formatted style (``numberdens_XXX.inp``)::

  iformat                                  <=== Typically 1 at present
  nrcells
  numberdensity[1]
  ..
  numberdensity[nrcells]

The number densities are to be specified in units of molecule per cubic
centimeter.


.. _sec-gas-temperature:

INPUT: The gas temperature
--------------------------

For line transfer we need to know the gas temperature. You specify this in the
file ``gas_temperature.inp`` (see Chapter :ref:`chap-binary-io` for the binary
version of these files, which are more compact, and which you can use instead of
the ascii versions). The structure of this file is identical to that described
in Section :ref:`sec-mol-numdensity`, but of course with number density replaced
by gas temperature in Kelvin. For the precise way to address the various cells
in the different AMR modes, we refer to Section :ref:`sec-dustdens`, where this
is described in detail.

Note: Instead of literally specifying the gas temperature you can also tell
``radmc3d`` to copy the dust temperature (if it know it) into the gas
temperature. See the keyword ``tgas_eq_tdust`` described in Section
:ref:`sec-line-radmc-inp`.


.. _sec-velo-field:

INPUT: The velocity field
-------------------------

Since gas motions are usually the main source of Doppler shift or broadening in
astrophysical settings, it is obligatory to specify the gas velocity.  This can
be done with the file ``gas_velocity.inp`` (see Chapter :ref:`chap-binary-io`
for the binary version of these files, which are more compact, and which you can
use instead of the ascii versions). The structure is again similar to that
described in Section :ref:`sec-mol-numdensity`, but now with three numbers at
each grid point instead of just one. The three numbers are the velocity in
:math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`z` direction for Cartesian coordinates, or in
:math:`r`, :math:`\theta` and :math:`\phi` direction for spherical
coordinates. Note that both in cartesian coordinates and in spherical
coordinates *all* velocity components have the same dimension of cm/s. For
spherical coordinates the conventions are: positive :math:`v_r` points outwards,
positive :math:`v_\theta` points downward (toward larger :math:`\theta`) for
:math:`0<\theta<\pi` (where 'downward' is toward smaller :math:`z`), and
positive :math:`v_\phi` means velocity in counter-clockwise direction in the
:math:`x,y`-plane.

For the precise way to address the various cells in the different AMR modes,
we refer to Section :ref:`sec-dustdens`, where this is described in detail.


.. _sec-turb-broadening:

INPUT: The local microturbulent broadening (optional)
-----------------------------------------------------

The ``radmc3d`` code automatically includes thermal broadening of the line. But
sometimes it is also useful to specify a local (spatially unresolved) turbulent
width. This is not obligatory (if it is not specified, only the thermal
broadening is used) but if you want to specify it, you can do so in the file
``microturbulence.inp`` (see Chapter :ref:`chap-binary-io` for the binary
version of these files, which are more compact, and which you can use instead of
the ascii versions). The file format is the same structure as described in
Section :ref:`sec-mol-numdensity`. For the precise way to address the various
cells in the different AMR modes, we refer to Section :ref:`sec-dustdens`, where
this is described in detail.

Here is the way it is included into the line profile:

.. math::

   a_{\mathrm{linewidth}}^2 = a^2_{\mathrm{turb}} + \frac{2kT_{\mathrm{gas}}}{\mu}

where :math:`T_{\mathrm{gas}}` is the temperature of the gas, :math:`\mu` the
molecular weight, :math:`k` the Boltzmann constant and :math:`a_{\mathrm{turb}}`
the microturbulent line width in units of cm/s. The
:math:`a_{\mathrm{linewidth}}` is then the total (thermal plus microturbulent)
line width.


.. _sec-partition-function:

INPUT for LTE line transfer: The partition function (optional)
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the LTE mode (either ``lines_mode=-1`` or ``lines_mode=1``), then the partition function is required to calculate, for
a given temperature the populations of the various levels. Since this
involves a summation over *all* levels of all kinds that can possibly be
populated, and since the molecular/atomic data file may not include all
these possible levels, it may be useful to look the partition function up in
some literature and give this to ``radmc3d``. This can be done with
the file ``partitionfunction_XXX.inp``, where again ``XXX``
is here a placeholder for the actual name of the molecule at hand. If you do
not have this file in the present model directory, then ``radmc3d``
will compute the partition function itself, but based on the (maybe limited)
set of levels given in the molecular data file. The structure of the
``partitionfunction_XXX.inp`` file is::

  iformat                    ; The usual format number, currently 1
  ntemp                      ; The number of temperatures at which it is specified
  temp(1)       pfunc(1)
  temp(2)       pfunc(2)
    .             .
    .             .
    .             .
  temp(ntemp)   pfunc(ntemp)

**NOTE:** RADMC-3D assumes the partition function to be defined in the following
way:

.. math::

   Z(T) = \sum_{i=1} g_ie^{-(E_i-E_1)/kT}

In other words: the first level is assumed to be the ground state. This is done
so that one can also use an energy definition in which the ground state energy
is non-zero (example: Hydrogen :math:`E_1=-13.6` eV). If you use molecular line
datafiles that contain only a subset of levels (which is in principle no problem
for LTE calculations) then it is essential that the ground state is included in
this list, and that it is the first level (``ilevel=1``).


.. _sec-collpartner:

INPUT: The number density of collision partners (for non-LTE transfer)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For non-LTE line transfer (see e.g. Sections :ref:`sec-lvg`,
:ref:`sec-optthinpop`) the molecules can be collisionally excited. The collision
rates for each pair of molecule + collision partner are given in the molecular
input data files (Section :ref:`sec-molecule-xxx-inp`). To find how often a
molecular level of a single molecule is collisionally excited to another level
we also need to know the number density of the collision partner molecules. In
the example in Section :ref:`sec-molecule-xxx-inp` these were para-H\ :math:`_2`
and ortho-H\ :math:`_2`. We must therefore somehow tell RADMC-3D what the number
densities of these molecules are. This is done by reading in the number
densities for this(these) collision partner(s).  The file for this has exactly
the same format as that for the number density of any molecule (see Section
:ref:`sec-mol-numdensity`). So for our example we would thus have two files,
which could be named ``numberdens_p-h2.inp`` and ``numberdens_o-h2.inp``
respectively.  See Section :ref:`sec-mol-numdensity` for details.

However, how does RADMC-3D know that the first collision partner of CO is called
``p-h2`` and the second ``o-h2``?  In principle the file ``molecule_co.inp``
give some information about the name of the collision partners. But this is
often not machine-readable.  Example, in ``molecule_co.inp`` of Section
:ref:`sec-molecule-xxx-inp` the line that should tell this reads::

   2 CO-pH2 from Flower (2001) & Wernli et al. (2006) + extrapolation

for the first of the two
(which is directly from the LAMDA database).  This is hard to decipher for
RADMC-3D. Therefore you have to tell this explicitly in the file ``lines.inp``,
and we refer to Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp` for how to do this.


Making images and spectra with line transfer
============================================

Making images and spectra with/of lines works in the same way as for the
continuum. RADMC-3D will check if the file ``lines.inp`` is present in your
directory, and if so, it will automatically switch on the line transfer. If you
insist on *not* having the lines switched on, in spite of the presence of the
``lines.inp`` file, you can add the option ``noline`` to ``radmc3d`` on the
command line. If you don't, then lines are normally automatically switched on,
except in situations where it is obviously not required.

You can just make an image at some wavelength and you'll get the image with
any line emission included if it is there. For instance, if you have 
the molecular data of CO included, then::

  radmc3d image lambda 2600.757

will give an image right at the CO 1-0 line center. The code will automatically
check if (and if yes, which) line(s) are contributing to the wavelength of
interest. Also it will include all the continuum emission (and absorption) that
you would usually obtain.

There is, however, an exception to this automatic line inclusion: If you make a
spectral energy distribution (with the command ``sed``, see Section
:ref:`sec-making-spectra`), then lines are not included. The same is true if you
use the ``loadcolor`` command.  But for normal spectra or images the line
emission will automatically be included.  So if you make a spectrum at
wavelength around some line, you will get a spectrum including the line profile
from the object, as well as the dust continuum.

It is not always convenient to have to know by heart the exact wavelengths
of the lines you are interested in. So RADMC-3D allows you to specify the
wavelength by specifying which line of which molecule, and at which velocity
you want to render::

  radmc3d image iline 2 vkms 2.4

If you have CO as your molecule, then iline 2 means CO 2-1 (the second
line in the rotational ladder). 

By default the first molecule is used (if you have more than one molecule),
but you can also specify another one::

  radmc3d image imolspec 2 iline 2 vkms 2.4

which would select the second molecule instead of the first one. 

If you wish to make an entire spectrum of the line, you can do for instance::

  radmc3d spectrum iline 1 widthkms 10

which produces a spectrum of the line with a passband going from -10 km/s to
+10 km/s. By default 40 wavelength points are used, and they are evenly
spaced. You can set this number of wavelengths::

  radmc3d spectrum iline 1 widthkms 10 linenlam 100

which would make a spectrum with 100 wavelength points, evenly spaced around
the line center. You can also shift the passband center::

  radmc3d spectrum iline 1 widthkms 10 linenlam 100 vkms -10

which would make the wavelength grid 10 kms shifted in short direction.

Note that you can use the ``widthkms`` and ``linenlam`` keywords also for
images::

  radmc3d image iline 1 widthkms 10 linenlam 100

This will make a multi-color image, i.e. it will make images at 100 wavelenths
points evenly spaced around the line center. In this way you can make channel
maps.

For more details on how to specify the spectral sampling, please read Section
:ref:`sec-set-camera-frequencies`. Note that keywords such as ``incl``, ``phi``,
and any other keywords specifying the camera position, zooming factor etc, can
all be used in addition to the above keywords.


.. _sec-line-render-speed-realism:

Speed versus realism of rendering of line images/spectra
--------------------------------------------------------

As usual with numerical modeling: including realism to the modeling goes at
the cost of rendering speed. A 'fully realistic' rendering of a model
spectrum or image of a gas line involves (assuming the level populations
are already known):

#. Doppler-shifted emission and absorption.
#. Inclusion of dust thermal emission and dust extinction while rendering
   the lines.
#. Continuum emission scattered by dust into the line-of-sight
#. Line emission from (possibly obscured) other regions is allowed to
   scatter into the line-of-sight by dust grains (see Section
   :ref:`sec-line-scat-off-dust`).

RADMC-3D always includes the Doppler shifts. By default, RADMC-3D also
includes dust thermal emission and extinction, as well as the scattered
continuum radiation. 

*For many lines, however, dust continuum scattering is a negligible
portion of the flux, so you can speed things up by not including dust
scattering!* This can be easily done by adding the ``noscat``
option on the command-line when you issue the command for a line spectrum or
multi-frequency image. This way, the scattering source function is not
computed (is assumed to be zero), and no scattering Monte Carlo runs are
necessary. This means that the ray-tracer can now render all wavelength
simultaneously (each ray doing all wavelength at the same time), and the
local level populations along each ray can now be computed once, and be used
for all wavelengths. *This may speed up things drastically, and for most
purposes virtually perfectly correct*. Just beware that when you render
short-wavelength lines (optical) or you use large grains, i.e. when the
scattering albedo at the wavelength of the line is not negligible, this may
result in a mis-estimation of the continuum around the line.


.. _sec-line-scat-off-dust:

Line emission scattered off dust grains
---------------------------------------
*NOTE: The contents of this subsection may not be 100\% implemented yet.*

Also any line emission from obscured regions that get scattered into the
line of sight by the dust (if dust scattering is included) will be
included. Note, however, that any possible Doppler shift *induced* by
this scattering is *not* included. This means that if line emission is
scattered by a dust cloud moving at a very large speed, then this line
emission will be scattered by the dust, but no Doppler shift at the
projected velocity of the dust will be added. Only the Doppler shift of the
line-emitting region is accounted for. This is rarely a problem, because
typically the dust that may scatter line emission is located far away from
the source of line emission and moves at substantially lower speed.


.. _sec-lvg:

Non-LTE Transfer: The Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) + Escape Probability (EscProb) method
=========================================================================================

The assumption that the energy levels of a molecule or atom are always
populated according to a thermal distribution (the so-called 'local
thermodynamic equilibrium', or LTE, assumption) is valid under certain
circumstances. For instance for planetary atmospheres in most cases.  But in
the dilute interstellar medium this assumption is very often invalid.  One
must then compute the level populations consistent with the local density
and temperature, and often also consistent with the local radiation
field. Part of this radiation field might even be the emission from the
lines themselves, meaning that the molecules radiatively influence their
neighbors. Solving the level populations self-consistently is called
'non-LTE radiative transfer'. A full non-LTE radiative transfer
calculation is, however, in most cases (a) too numerically demanding and
sometimes (b) unnecessary. Sometimes a simple approximation of the non-LTE
effects is sufficient.

One such approximation method is the 'Large Velocity Gradient' (LVG)
method, also called the 'Sobolev approximation'.  Please read for instance
the paper by Ossenkopf (1997) 'The Sobolev approximation in molecular
clouds', New Astronomy, 2, 365 for more explanation, and a study how it
works in the context of molecular clouds. The LVG mode of RADMC-3D has been
used for the first time by Shetty et al. (2011, MNRAS 412, 1686), and a
description of the method is included in that paper.  The nice aspect of
this method is that it is, for most part, local. The only slightly non-local
aspect is that a velocity gradient has to be computed by comparing the gas
velocity in one cell with the gas velocity in neighboring cells.

As of RADMC-3D Version 0.33 the LVG method is combined with an escape
probability (EscProb) method. In fact, LVG *is* a kind of escape probability
method itself. It is just that for the classic EscProb method the photons can
escape due to the finite size of the object, and thus the finite optical
depth in the lines. In the LVG the object size is not the issue, but the
gradient of the velocity. The line width combined with the velocity gradient
give a length scale over which a photon can escape. 

In the LVG + EscProb method the line-integrated mean intensity :math:`J_{ij}` is
given by

.. _eq-linemeanint-escp:

.. math::

   J_{ij} = (1-\beta_{ij})S_{ij} + \beta_{ij}J_{ij}^{\mathrm{bg}}

where :math:`J_{ij}^{\mathrm{bg}}` is the mean intensity of the background
radiation field at frequency :math:`\nu=\nu_{ij}` (default is blackbody at 2.73 K,
but this temperature can be varied with the ``lines_tbg`` variable
in ``radmc3d.inp``), while :math:`\beta_{ij}` is the escape probability
for line :math:`i\rightarrow j`. This is given by

.. _eq-escprob-beta-formula:

.. math::

   \beta_{ij} = \frac{1-\exp(-\tau_{ij})}{\tau_{ij}}

where :math:`\tau_{ij}` is the line-center optical depth in the line. 

For the LVG method this optical depth is given by the velocity gradient:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   \tau_{ij}^{\mathrm{LVG}} & = \frac{ch}{4\pi}\frac{N_{\mathrm{molec}}}
   {1.064\,|\nabla \vec v|}\left[n_jB_{ji}-n_iB_{ij}\right]\\
   &= \frac{c^3}{8\pi \nu_{ij}^3}\frac{A_{ij}N_{\mathrm{molec}}}
   {1.064\,|\nabla \vec v|}\left[\frac{g_i}{g_j}n_j-n_i\right]
   \end{split}

(see e.g. van der Tak et al. 2007, A&A 468, 627), where :math:`n_i` is the
fractional level population of level :math:`i`, :math:`N_{\mathrm{molec}}` the
total number density of the molecule, :math:`|\nabla \vec v|` the absolute value
of the velocity gradient, :math:`g_i` the statistical weight of level :math:`i`
and :math:`\nu_{ij}` the line frequency for transition :math:`i\rightarrow
j`. In comparing to Eq. 21 of van der Tak's paper, note that their
:math:`N_{\mathrm{mol}}` is a column density (cm\ :math:`^{-2}`) and their
:math:`\Delta V` is the line width (cm/s), while our :math:`N_{\mathrm{molec}}`
is the number density (cm\ :math:`^{-3}`) and :math:`|\nabla \vec v|` is the
velocity gradient (s\ :math:`^{-1}`). Their formula is thus in fact EscProb while
ours is LVG.

For the EscProb method *without* velocity gradients, we need to be able to
compute the total column depth :math:`\Sigma_{\mathrm{molec}}` in the direction
where this :math:`\Sigma_{\mathrm{molec}}` is minimal. This is something that,
at the moment, RADMC-3D cannot yet do. But this is something that can be
estimated based on a 'typical length scale' :math:`L`, such that

.. math::

   \Sigma_{\mathrm{molec}} \simeq N_{\mathrm{molec}}\, L

RADMC-3D allows you to specify :math:`L` separately for each cell (in the file
``escprob_lengthscale.inp`` or its binary version). The simplest would be to set
it to a global value equal to the typical size of the object we are interested
in. Then the line-center optical depth, assuming a Gaussian line profile with
width :math:`a_{\mathrm{linewidth}}`, is

.. math::

   \tau_{ij}^{\mathrm{EscProb}} = \frac{hc \Sigma_{\mathrm{molec}}}{4\pi\sqrt{\pi}\,a_{\mathrm{linewidth}}}\left[n_jB_{ji}-n_iB_{ij}\right]

because :math:`\phi(\nu=\nu_{ij})=c/(a\nu_{ij}\sqrt{\pi})`. 

The optical depth of the combined LVG + EscProb method is then:

.. math::

   \tau_{ij} = \mathrm{min}\left(\tau_{ij}^{\mathrm{LVG}},\tau_{ij}^{\mathrm{EscProb}}\right)

This is then the :math:`\tau_{ij}` that needs to be inserted into
Eq. (:ref:`eq-escprob-beta-formula`) for obtaining the escape probability
:math:`\beta_{ij}` (which includes escape due to LVG as well as the finite
length scale :math:`L`).

The LVG+EscProb method solves at each location the following statistical
equilibrium equation:

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   & \sum_{j>i} \Big[ n_jA_{ji} + (n_jB_{ji}-n_iB_{ij})J_{ji}\Big]\\
   & - \sum_{j<i} \Big[ n_iA_{ij} + (n_iB_{ij}-n_jB_{ji})J_{ij}\Big]\\
   & + \sum_{j\neq i}\big[n_jC_{ji}-n_iC_{ij}\big]=0
   \end{split}

Replacing :math:`J_{ij}` (and similarly :math:`J_{ji}`) with the expression of
Eq. (:ref:`eq-linemeanint-escp`) and subsequently replacing :math:`S_{ij}` with
the well-known expression for the line source function

.. math::

   S_{ij} = \frac{n_iA_{ij}}{n_jB_{ji}-n_iB_{ij}}
   
leads to

.. math::

   \begin{split}
   & \sum_{j>i} \Big[ n_jA_{ji}\beta_{ji} + (n_jB_{ji}-n_iB_{ij})\beta_{ji}J^{\mathrm{bg}}_{ji}\Big]\\
   & - \sum_{j<i} \Big[ n_iA_{ij}\beta_{ij} + (n_iB_{ij}-n_jB_{ji})\beta_{ij}J^{\mathrm{bg}}_{ij}\Big]\\
   & + \sum_{j\neq i}\big[n_jC_{ji}-n_iC_{ij}\big]=0
   \end{split}

A few iteration steps are necessary, because the :math:`\beta_{ij}` depends on the
optical depths, which depend on the populations. But since this is only a
weak dependence, the iteration should converge rapidly.

To use the LVG+EscProb method, the following has to be done:

* Make sure that you use a molecular data file that contains
  collision rate tables (see Section :ref:`sec-molecule-xxx-inp`).
* Make sure to provide file(s) containing the number densities
  of the collision partners, e.g. ``numberdens_p-h2.inp``
  (see Section :ref:`sec-collpartner`).
* Make sure to link the rate tables to the number density
  files in ``lines.inp`` (see Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp`).
* Set the ``lines_mode=3`` in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file.
* You may want to also specify the maximum number of iterations for
  non-LTE iterations, by setting ``lines_nonlte_maxiter`` in the
  ``radmc3d.inp`` file. The default is 100 (as of version 0.36). If
  convergence is not reached within ``lines_nonlte_maxiter``
  iterations, RADMC-3D stops.
* You may want to also specify the convergence criterion
  for non-LTE iterations, by setting ``lines_nonlte_convcrit``
  in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file. The default is 1d-2 (which is
  not very strict! Smaller values may be necessary).
* Specify the gas velocity vector field in the file ``gas_velocity.inp``
  (or ``.binp``), see Section
  :ref:`sec-velo-field`. If this file is not present, the gas velocity will
  be assumed to be 0 everywhere, meaning that you have pure escape
  probability.
* Specify the 'typical length scale' :math:`L` at each cell in the file
  ``escprob_lengthscale.inp`` (or ``.binp``). If 
  this file is not present, then the length scale is assumed to be infinite,
  meaning that you are back at pure LVG. The format of this file is
  identical to that of the gas density. 

Note that having no ``escprob_lengthscale.inp`` *nor* ``gas_velocity.inp`` file
in your model directory means that the photons cannot escape at all, and you
should find LTE populations (always a good test of the code).

Note that it is essential, when using the Large Velocity Gradient method without
specifying a length scale, that the gradients in the velocity field (given in
the file ``gas_velocity.inp``, see Section :ref:`sec-velo-field`) are indeed
sufficiently large. If they are zero, then this effectively means that the
optical depth in all the lines is assumed to be infinite, which means that the
populations are LTE again. If you use LVG but *also* specify a length scale in
the ``escprob_lengthscale.inp`` file, then this danger of unphysically LTE
populations is avoided.

*NOTE: Currently this method does not yet include radiative exchange
with the dust continuum radiation field.*

*NOTE: Currently this method does not yet include radiative pumping
by stellar radiation. Will be included soon.*


.. _sec-optthinpop:

Non-LTE Transfer: The optically thin line assumption method
===========================================================

An even simpler non-LTE method is applicable in *very* dilute
media, in which the lines are all optically thin. This means that
a photon that is emitted by the gas will never be reabsorbed. 
If this condition is satisfied, then the non-LTE level populations
can be computed even easier than in the case of LVG (Section
:ref:`sec-lvg`). No iteration is then required. So to activate
this, the following has to be done:

* Make sure that you use a molecular data file that contains
  collision rate tables (see Section :ref:`sec-molecule-xxx-inp`).
* Make sure to provide file(s) containing the number densities
  of the collision partners, e.g. ``numberdens_p-h2.inp``
  (see Section :ref:`sec-collpartner`).
* Make sure to link the rate tables to the number density
  files in ``lines.inp`` (see Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp`).
* Set the ``lines_mode=4`` in the ``radmc3d.inp``
  file (see Section :ref:`sec-radmc-inp`).

*NOTE: Currently this method does not yet include radiative pumping
by stellar radiation.*

*NOTE: This mode does not *make* a model optically thin. Only
the populations of the levels are computed under the {\bf assumption}
that the lines are optically thin. If you subsequently make a spectrum
or image of your model, all absorption effects are again included.*

.. _sec-nonlte-nonlocal:

Non-LTE Transfer: Full non-local modes (FUTURE)
===============================================

In the near future RADMC-3D will hopefully also feature full non-LTE transfer,
in which the level populations are coupled to the full non-local radiation
field. Methods such as *lambda iteration* and *accelerated lambda iteration*
will be implemented. For nomenclature we will call these 'non-local non-LTE
modes'.

For these non-local non-LTE modes the level population calculation is done
separately from the image/spectrum ray-tracing: You will run RADMC-3D first
for computing the non-LTE populations. RADMC-3D will then write these to
file. Then you will call RADMC-3D for making images/spectra. This is very
similar to the dust transfer, in which you first call RADMC-3D for the Monte
Carlo dust temperature computation, and after that for the ray-tracing.  It
is, however, different from the *local non-LTE* modes, where the
populations are calculated automatically before any image/spectrum
ray-tracing, and the populations do not have to be written to file (only if
you want to inspect them: Section :ref:`sec-nonlte-write-levelpop`).

For now, however, RADMC-3D still does not have the non-local non-LTE
modes.

.. _sec-nonlte-write-levelpop:

Non-LTE Transfer: Inspecting the level populations
==================================================

When doing line radiative transfer it is often useful to inspect the level
populations. For instance, you may want to inspect how far from LTE your
populations are, or just check if the results are reasonable.  There are two
ways to do this:

#. When making an image or spectrum, add the command-line option
   ``writepop``, which will make RADMC-3D create output files
   containing the level population values. Example::
     
     radmc3d image lambda 2300 writepop

#. Just calling ``radmc3d`` with the command-line 
   option ``calcpop``, which will ask RADMC-3D to compute the
   populations and write them to file, even without making any images
   or spectra. Example::

     radmc3d calcpop

NOTE: For (future) non-local non-LTE modes (Section :ref:`sec-nonlte-nonlocal`)
these level populations will anyway be written to a file, irrespective of the
``writepop`` command.

The resulting files will have names such as ``levelpop_co.dat``
(for the CO molecule). The structure is as follows::

  iformat                                  <=== Typically 1 at present
  nrcells
  nrlevels_subset
  level1  level2 .....                     <=== The level subset selection
  popul[level1,1]  popul[level2,1] .....   <=== Populations (for subset) at cell 1
  popul[level1,2]  popul[level2,2] .....   <=== Populations (for subset) at cell 2
  .
  .
  popul[level1,nrcells]   popul[level2,nrcells] ....

The first number is the format number, which is simply for RADMC-3D to be
backward compatible in the future, in case we decide to change/improve the
file format. The nrcells is the number of cells. 

Then follows the number of levels (written as ``nrlevels_subset`` above). Note
that this is *not necessarily* equal to the number of levels found in the
``molecule_co.inp`` file (for our CO example). It will only be equal to that if
the file has been produced by the command ``radmc3d calcpop``. If, however, the
file was produced after making an image or spectrum (e.g. through the command
``radmc3d image lambda 2300 writepop``), then RADMC-3D will only write out those
levels that have been used to make the image or spectrum. See Section
:ref:`sec-calcstore-levpop` for more information about this. It is for this
reason that the file in fact contains a list of levels that are included (the
``level1 level 2 ...`` in the above file format example).

After these header lines follows the actual data. Each line contains the
populations at a spatial cell in units of :math:`\mathrm{cm}^{-3}`. 

This file format is a generalization of the standard format which is
described for the example of dust density in Section :ref:`sec-dustdens`.
Please read that section for more details, and also on how the format
changes if you use 'layers'. 

Also the unformatted style is described in Section :ref:`sec-dustdens`. We
have, however, here the extra complication that at each cell we have more
than one number. Essentially this simply means that the length of the data
per cell is larger, so that fewer cells fit into a single record.


.. _sec-nonlte-read-levelpop:

Non-LTE Transfer: Reading the level populations from file
=========================================================

Sometimes you may want to make images and/or spectra of lines based on level
populations that you calculated using another program (or calculated using
RADMC-3D at some earlier time). You can ask RADMC-3D to read these
populations from files with the same name and same format as, for example,
``levelpop_co.dat`` (for CO) as described in Section
:ref:`sec-nonlte-write-levelpop`. The way to do this is to add a line::

       lines_mode = 50

to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file. 

You can test that it works by calculating the populations using another
``lines_mode`` and calling ``radmc3d calcpop writepop`` (which will produce the
``levelpop_xxx.dat`` file); then change ``lines_mode`` to 50, and call ``radmc3d
image iline 1``. You should see a message that RAMDC-3D is actually reading the
populations (and it may, for 3-D models, take a bit of time to read the large
file).

Because of the rather lage size of these files for 3-D models, it might be
worthwhile to make sure to reduce the number of levels of the
``molecule_xx.inp`` files to only those you actually need.


.. _sec-lines-pitfalls:

What can go wrong with line transfer?
========================================

Even the simple task of performing a ray-tracing line transfer calculation
with given level populations (i.e. the so-called *formal transfer
equation*) is a non-trivial task in complex 3-D AMR models with possibly
highly supersonic motions. I recommend the user to do extensive and critical
experimentation with the code and make many simple tests to check if the
results are as they are expected to be. In the end a result must be
understandable in terms of simple argumentation. If weird effects show up,
please do some detective work until you understand why they show up, i.e.
that they are either a *real* effect or a numerical issue. There are
many numerical artifacts that can show up that are *not* a bug in the
code. The code simply does a numerical integration of the equations on some
spatial- and wavelength-grid. If the user chooses these grids unwisely, the
results may be completely wrong even if the code is formally OK. These
possible pitfalls is what this section is about.

So here is a list of things to check:

#. Make sure that the line(s) you want to model are indeed in the
   molecular data file you use. Also make sure that it/they are included in
   the line selection (if you are using this option; by default all lines and
   levels from the molecular/atomic data files are included; see Section
   :ref:`sec-calcstore-levpop`).
#. If you do LTE line transfer, and you do not let ``radmc3d``
   read in a special file for the partition function, then the partition
   function will be computed internally by ``radmc3d``. The code will
   do so based on the levels specified in the ``molecule_XXX.inp``
   file for molecule ``XXX``. This requires of course that all levels
   that may be excited at the temperatures found in the model are in fact
   present in the ``molecule_XXX.inp`` file. If, for instance, you
   model 1.3 mm and 2.6 mm rotational lines of CO gas of up to 300 K, and
   your file ``molecule_co.inp`` only contains the first three
   levels because you think you only need those for your 1.3 and 2.6 mm
   lines, and you *don't* specify the partition function explicitly, then
   ``radmc3d`` will compute the partition function for all
   temperatures including 300 K based on only the first three levels. This is
   evidently wrong. The nasty thing is: the resulting lines won't be totally
   absurd. They will just be too bright. But this can easily go undetected by
   you as the user. So please keep this always in mind.  Note that if you
   make a *selection* of the first three levels (see Section
   :ref:`sec-line-selection`) but the file ``molecule_XXX.inp``
   contains many more levels, then this problem will not appear, because the
   partition function will be calculated on the original data from the
   ``molecule_XXX.inp`` file, not from the selected levels.  Of
   course it is safer to specify the true partition function directly through
   the file ``partitionfunction_XXX.inp`` (see Section
   :ref:`sec-partition-function`).
#. If you have a model with non-zero gas velocities, and if these gas
   velocities have cell-to-cell differences that are larger than or equal to
   the intrinsic (thermal+microturbulent) line width, then the ray-tracing
   will not be able to pick up signals from intermediate velocities. In other
   words, because of the discrete gridding of the model, only discrete
   velocities are present, which can cause numerical problems. See
   Fig. :numref:`fig-doppler-catch`-Left for a pictographic representation of
   this problem. There are two possible solutions. One is the wavelength band
   method described in Section :ref:`sec-wavelength-bands`.  But a more
   systematic method is the 'doppler catching' method described in Section
   :ref:`sec-doppler-catching` (which can be combined with the wavelength band
   method of Section :ref:`sec-wavelength-bands` to make it even more
   perfect).


.. _sec-doppler-catching:

Preventing doppler jumps: The 'doppler catching method'
=======================================================

If the local co-moving line width of a line (due to thermal/fundamental
broadning and/or local subgrid 'microturbulence') is much smaller than the
typical velocity fields in the model, then a dangerous situation can
occur. This can happen if the co-moving line width is narrower than the
doppler shift between two adjacent cells. When a ray is traced, in one cell
the line can then have a doppler shift substantially to the blue of the
wavelength-of-sight, while in the next cell the line suddenly shifted to the
red side. If the intrinsic (= thermal + microturbulent) line width is
smaller than these shifts, neither cell gives a contribution to the emission
in the ray. See Fig. :numref:`fig-doppler-jump` for a pictographic
representation of this problem. In reality the doppler shift between these
two cells would be smooth, and thus the line would smoothly pass over the
wavelength-of-sight, and thus make a contribution. Therefore the numerical
integration may thus go wrong.

.. _fig-doppler-jump:

.. figure:: Figures/line_doppjump.*
   :width: 75%

   Pictographic representation of the doppler jumping problem with 
   ray-tracing through a model with strong cell-to-cell velocity differences. 

.. _fig-doppler-catch:

.. figure:: Figures/line_doppcatch.*
   :width: 75%

   Right: Pictographic representation of the doppler catching method to 
   prevent this problem: First of all, second order integration is done
   instead of first order. Secondly, the method automatically detects a
   possibly dangerous doppler jump and makes sub-steps to neatly integrate
   over the line that shifts in- and out of the wavelength channel of 
   interest. 

The problem is described in more detail in Section :ref:`sec-wavelength-bands`,
and one possible solution is proposed there.  But that solution does not always
solve the problem.

RADMC-3D has a special method to catch situations like the above, and when
it detects one, to make sub-steps in the integration of the formal transfer
equation so that the smooth passing of the line through the
wavelength-of-sight can be properly accounted for. Here this is called
'doppler catching', for lack of a better name. The technique was discussed
in great detail in Pontoppidan et al. (2009, ApJ 704, 1482). The idea is
that the method automatically tests if a line might 'doppler jump' over
the current wavelength channel. If so, it will insert substeps in the
integration at the location where this danger is present. See
Fig. :numref:`fig-doppler-catch` for a pictographic representation of this
method. Note that this method can only be used with the second order
ray-tracing (see Section :ref:`sec-second-order`); in fact, as soon as you
switch the doppler catching on, RADMC-3D will automatically also switch on
the second order ray-tracing.

To switch on doppler catching, you simply add the command-line option 
``doppcatch`` to the image or spectrum command. For instance::

  radmc3d spectrum iline 1 widthkms 10 doppcatch

(again: you do not need to add ``secondorder``, because it is automatic when
``doppcatch`` is used). Or for an image::

  radmc3d image iline 1 vkms 1.3 doppcatch

The Doppler catching method will assure that the line is integrated over with
small enough steps that it cannot accidently get jumped over. How fine these
steps will be can be adjusted with the ``catch_doppler_resolution`` keyword in
the ``radmc3d.inp`` file. The default value is 0.2, meaning that it will make
the integration steps small enough that the doppler shift over each step is not
more than 0.2 times the local intrinsic (thermal+microturbulent) line
width. That is usually enough, but for some problems it might be important to
ensure that smaller steps are taken. By adding a line::

  catch_doppler_resolution = 0.05

to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file you will ensure that steps are small
enough that the doppler shift is at most 0.05 times the local line width.

So why is doppler catching an *option*, i.e. why would this not be standard?
The reason is that doppler catching requires second order integration, which
requires RADMC-3D to first map all the cell-based quantities to the
cell-corners. This requires extra memory, which for very large models can be
problematic. It also requires more CPU time to calculate images/spectra with
second order integration. So if you do not need it, i.e. if your velocity
gradients are not very steep compared to the intrinsic line width, then it saves
time and memory to not use doppler catching.

It is, however, important to realize that doppler catching is not the golden
bullet. Even with doppler catching it might happen that some line flux is lost,
but this time as a result of too low *image resolution*. This is less likely to
happen in problems like ISM turbulence, but it is pretty likely to happen in
models of rotating disks. Suppose we have a very thin local line width (i.e.
low gas temperature and no microturbulence) in a rotating thin disk around a
star. In a given velocity channel (i.e. at a given observer-frame frequency) a
molecular line in the disk emits only in a very thin 'ear-shaped' ring or band
in the image. The thinner the intrinsic line width, the thinner the band on the
image. See Pontoppidan et al. (2009, ApJ 704, 1482) and Pavlyuchenkov et
al. (2007, ApJ 669, 1262) for example. If the pixel-resolution of the image is
smaller than that of this band, the image is simply underresolved.  This has
nothing to do with the doppler jumping problem, but can be equally devastating
for the results if the user is unaware of this. There appears to be only one
proper solution: assure that the pixel-resolution of the image is sufficiently
fine for the problem at hand. This is easy to find out: The image would simply
look terribly noisy if the resolution is insufficient. However, if you are not
interested in the images, but only in the spectra, then some amount of noisiness
in the image (i.e. marginally sufficient resolution) is OK, since the total
flux is an integral over the entire image, smearing out much of the noise.  It
requires some experimentation, though.

Here are some additional issues to keep in mind:

* The doppler catching method uses second order integration (see Section
  :ref:`sec-second-order`), and therefore all the relevant quantities first
  have to be interpolated from the cell centers to the cell corners. Well
  inside the computational domain this amounts to linear interpolation. But
  at the edges of the domain it would require *extra* polation.
  In 1-D this is more easily illustrated, because
  there the cell corners are in fact cell interfaces. Cells :math:`i` and :math:`i+1`
  share cell interface :math:`i+1/2`. If we have :math:`N` cells, i.e. cells
  :math:`i=1,\cdots,N`, then we have :math:`N+1` interfaces, i.e. interfaces
  :math:`i=\tfrac{1}{2},\cdots,N+\tfrac{1}{2}`. To get physical quantities from
  the cell centers to cell interfaces
  :math:`i=\tfrac{3}{2},\cdots,N-\tfrac{1}{2}` requires just interpolation. But
  to find the physical quantities at cell interfaces :math:`i=\tfrac{1}{2}` and
  :math:`i=N+\tfrac{1}{2}` one has to extrapolate or simply take the values at
  the cell centers :math:`i=1` and :math:`i=N`. RADMC-3D does not do
  extrapolation but simply takes the average values of the nearest
  cells. Also the gas velocity is treated like this. This means that over
  the edge cells the gradient in the gas velocity tends to be (near)
  0. Since for the doppler catching it is the gradient of the velocity that
  matters, this might yield some artifacts in the spectrum if the density in
  the border cells is high enough to produce substantial line
  emission. Avoiding this numerical artifact is relatively easy: One should
  then simply put the number density of the molecule in question to zero in
  the boundary cells.
* If you are using RADMC-3D on a 3-D (M)HD model which has strong shocks
  in its domain, then one must be careful that (magneto-)hydrodynamic codes
  tend to smear out the shock a bit. This means that there will be some
  cells that have intermediate density and velocity in the smeared out
  region of the shock. This is unphysical, but an intrinsic numerical
  artifact of numerical hydrodynamics codes. This might, under some
  conditions, lead to unphysical signal in the spectrum, because there would
  be cells at densities, temperatures and velocities that would be in
  between the values at both sides of the shock and would, in reality, not
  be there. It is very difficult to avoid this problem, and even to find out
  if this problem is occurring and by how much. One must simply be very
  careful of models containing strong shocks and do lots of testing.  One
  way to test is to use the doppler catching method and vary the doppler
  catching resolution (using the ``catch_doppler_resolution``
  keyword in ``radmc3d.inp``).
* If using line transfer in spherical coordinates using doppler
  catching, the linear interpolation of the line shift between the beginning
  and the end of a segment may not always be enough to accurately prevent
  doppler jumps. This is because in addition to the physical gradient of gas
  velocity, the projected gas velocity along a ray changes also along the
  ray due to the geometry (the use of spherical coordinates). Example: a
  spherically symmetric radially outflowing wind with constant outward
  velocity :math:`v_r=`const. Although :math:`v_r` is constant, the 3-D *vector*
  :math:`\vec v` is not constant, since it always points outward. A ray through
  this wind will thus have a varying :math:`\vec n\cdot \vec v` along the ray.  In
  the cell where the ray reaches its closest approach to the origin of the
  coordinate system the :math:`\vec n\cdot \vec v` will vary the strongest.  This
  may be such a strong effect that it could affect the reliability of the
  code. *As of version 0.41 of this code a method is in place to prevent
  this*. It is switched on by default, but it can be switched off manually
  for testing purposes. See Section :ref:`sec-secord-spher` for details.

Preventing doppler jumps (alternative method): Artificial line widening
=======================================================================

For preventing doppler jumps it is always preferable to use the above described
doppler catching method. However, sometimes this method may not be available
(e.g., for Voronoi grids, although one could in that case switch to Delaunay
grids, for which it is available). In that case there is an alternative, albeit
less elegant, way to avoid dopper jumps: artificial line widening.

The idea is based on the fact that the danger of doppler jumps only occurs when
the velocity difference between neighboring cells is larger than the local line
width (thermal + microturbulent). By artificially adding more "microturbulence"
such that the local line width is no longer narrower than the cell-to-cell
velocity differences, one can artificially "solve" the problem of doppler
jumps.

One way of doing this is "by hand": Simply provide RADMC-3D with a microturbulence
file (see Section :ref:`sec-turb-broadening`) that contains the required amount
of microturbulence. The problem is that this requires you, the user, to compute
the velocity differences between all neighboring cells, which is a non-trivial
task.

So instead, you can ask RADMC-3D to compute this for you. You should give
RADMC-3D a number called ``linewideningfactor`` (either in ``radmc3d.inp``
or on the command line) which is the "safety factor" by which RADMC-3D
will assure enough microturbulence to avoid doppler jumps. RADMC-3D will
never reduce any already specified microturbulence, but if it finds that
the combined microturbulence and thermal broadning is less than required
for compensating the maximum cell-to-neighbor velocity difference
by a factor ``linewideningfactor``, it will increase the microturbulence
accordingly. The larger you choose ``linewideningfactor``, the safer
you are, but the drawback is that the lines will become much broader
than they really are physically. The smaller you choose ``linewideningfactor``,
the less you unphysically broaden the line, but the higher the risk remains
for doppler jump effects. A value between 0.2 and 1.0 is reasonable,
but some experimentation is recommended.

Staying with the example from the previous section, we would
write the following on the command line::

  radmc3d image iline 1 vkms 1.3 linewideningfactor 0.3

.. _sec-calcstore-levpop:

Background information: Calculation and storage of level populations
====================================================================

If RADMC-3D makes an image or a spectrum with molecular (or atomic) lines
included, then the level populations of the molecules/atoms have to be
computed. In the standard method of ray-tracing of images or spectra, these
level populations are first calculated in each grid cell and stored in a global
array. Then the raytracer will render the image or spectrum.

The storage of the level populations is a tricky matter, because if this is done
in the obvious manner, it might require a huge amount of memory. This would then
prevent us from making large scale models. For instance: if you have a molecule
with 100 levels in a model with 256x256x256 :math:`\simeq 1.7\times 10^7` cells,
the global storage for the populations alone (with each number in double
precision) would be roughly 100x8x256x256x256 :math:`\simeq` 13 Gigabyte.

However, if you intend to make a spectrum in just 1 line, you do not need all
these level populations. To stick to the above example, let us take the CO 1-0
line, which is then line 1 and which connects levels :math:`J=1` and
:math:`J=0`, which are levels 2 and 1 in the code (if you use the Leiden
database CO data file).  Once the populations have been computed, we only need
to store the levels 1 and 2. This would then require 2x8x256x256x256
:math:`\simeq` 0.26 Gigabyte, which would be *much* less memory-costly.

As of version 0.29 RADMC-3D automatically figures out which levels have to
be stored in a global array, in order to be able to render the images or the
spectrum properly. RADMC-3D will go through all the lines of all molecules
and checks if they contribute to the wavelength(s), of the image(s) or the
spectrum. Once it has assembled a list of 'active' lines, it will make a
list of 'active' levels that belong to these lines. It will then declare
this to be the 'subset' of levels for which the populations will be stored
globally.

In other words: RADMC-3D now takes care of the memory-saving storage of
the populations automatically.

*How does RADMC-3D decide whether a line contributes to some wavelength*
:math:`\lambda`? A line :math:`i` with line center :math:`\lambda_i` is
considered to contribute to an image at wavelength :math:`\lambda` if

.. math::

   | \lambda_i-\lambda | \le C_{\mathrm{margin}}\Delta\lambda_i

where :math:`\Delta\lambda_i` is the line width (including all contributions)
and :math:`C_{\mathrm{margin}}` is a constant. By default

.. math::

   C_{\mathrm{margin}} = 12

But you can change this to another value, say 24, by adding in the
``radmc3d.inp`` file a line containing, e.g. ``lines_widthmargin = 24``.

You can in fact get a dump of the level populations that have been computed and
used for the image(s)/spectrum you created, by adding ``writepop`` on the
command line. Example::

  radmc3d spectrum iline 1 widthkms 10 writepop

This then creates (in addition to the spectrum) a file called (for our
example of the CO molecule) ``levelpop_co.dat``. Here is how you can read
this data in Python::

  from radmc3d_tools import simpleread
  data = simpleread.read_levelpop()

The ``data`` object then contains ``data.pop`` and ``data.relpop``, which are
the level populations in :math:`1/cm^3` and in normalized form.

If, for some reason, you want always *all* levels to be stored (and you can
afford to do so with the size of your computer's memory), you can make RADMC-3D
do so by adding ``noautosubset`` as a keyword to the command line, or by adding
``lines_autosubset = 0`` to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file. However, for other than
code testing purposes, it seems unlikely you will wish to do this.

.. _sec-onthefly:

In case it is necessary: On-the-fly calculation of populations
==============================================================

There might be rare circumstances in which you do not want to have to store
the level populations in a global array. For example: you are making a spectrum
of the CO bandhead, in which case you have many tens of lines in a single
spectrum. If your model contains 256x256x256 cells (see example in Section
:ref:`sec-calcstore-levpop`) then this might easily require many Gigabytes of
memory just to store the populations. 

For the LTE, LVG and optically thin level population modes there is a way out:
You can force RADMC-3D to compute the populations *on-the-fly* during the
ray-tracing, which does not require a global storage of the level populations.

The way to do this is simple: Just make the ``lines_mode`` negative. So for
on-the-fly LTE mode use ``lines_mode=-1``, for on-the-fly user-defined
populations mode use ``lines_mode=-2``, for on-the-fly LVG mode use
``lines_mode=-3`` and for on-the-fly optically thin populations use
``lines_mode=-4``.

*NOTE: The drawback of this method is that, under certain circumstances, it can
slow down the code dramatically.* This slow-down happens if you use e.g.
second-order integration (Section :ref:`sec-second-order`) and/or doppler
catching (Section :ref:`sec-doppler-catching`) together with non-trivial
population solving methods like LVG. So please use the on-the-fly method only
when you are forced to do so (for memory reasons).


.. _sec-line-selection:

For experts: Selecting a subset of lines and levels 'manually'
==============================================================

As explained in Section :ref:`sec-calcstore-levpop`, RADMC-3D automatically
makes a selection of levels for which it will allocate memory for the global
level population storage.

If, for some reason, you wish to make this selection yourself 'by hand', this
can also be done. However, please be informed that there are very few
circumstances under which you may want to do this. The automatic subset
selection of RADMC-3D is usually sufficient!

*If* you decided to really want to do this, here is how:

#. Switch off the automatic subset selection by adding ``noautosubset`` as
   a keyword to the command line, or by adding ``lines_autosubset = 0`` to
   the ``radmc3d.inp`` file.
#. In the ``lines.inp`` file, for each molecule, modify the
   '0 0' (the first two zeroes after 'leiden') in the way described below.

In Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp` you can see that each molecule has a line
like::

  co   leiden   0  0  0

or so (here for the example of CO). In Section :ref:`sec-line-dot-inp` we
explained the meaning of the third number, but we did not explain the meaning of
the first and second ones. These are meant for this subset selection. If we want
to store only the first 10 levels of the CO molecule, then replace the above
line with::

  co   leiden   0  10  0

If you want to select specific levels (let us choose the ``ilevel=3`` and
``ilevel=4`` levels of the above example), then write::

  co   leiden   1  2  0
  3 4

The '1' says that a list of levels follows, the '2' says that two levels will be
selected and the next line with '3' and '4' say that levels 3 and 4 should be
selected.
