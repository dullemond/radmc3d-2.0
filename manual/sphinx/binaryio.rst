Overview
========


By default all input and output files of RADMC-3D are in ASCII (i.e.\ text)
form. This makes it easier to verify if the files are ok. Also, it is easier
to produce files with the right format and read the output of RADMC-3D. The
disadvantage is that ASCII files are substantially larger than strictly
required to store their information content. For large models, i.e.\ models
with many grid points, this may lead to unpractically large files.

RADMC-3D supports a more compact data format: binary data. In this form, a
double precision variable occupies just 8 bytes, while a single precision
variable occupies just 4 bytes.

Unfortunately, Fortran-90 and Fortran-95 did, for a long time, not support true
binary files. Instead they offered 'f77-unformatted' files, which uses
'records', and is harder to read than true binary files. Recently, however, many
Fortran-90 and Fortran-95 compilers have introduced a true binary format, which
is called 'streaming access'. It is, actually, a Fortran-2003 feature, but has
been retroactively implemented into Fortran-90 and Fortran-95. The gfortran and
g95 compilers have it. Also the ifort compiler has it. Presumably others as
well.

RADMC-3D offers a binary I/O capability. A file containing three double
precision variables will have a length of exactly 24 bytes. Files with this
format will have extensions such as ``.binp``\ , ``.bdat`` or ``.bout``\ .

Here is a (presumably incomplete) list of files that have binary versions:

+------------------------+-----------+------------+

.. _sec-switch-to-binary:

How to switch to binary (or back to ascii)
==========================================

Specifying whether RADMC-3D should use ASCII or binary *input* is easy: It will
simply look which extension each input file has, and read it accordingly. If you
present RADMC-3D file input files with extension ``.binp``\ , it will read these
files as binaries.

More tricky is how to tell RADMC-3D to use binary files on *output*. By default,
RADMC-3D will always write ASCII style (``.out`` and ``.dat``\ ). However, if
you add the following line to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file: ::

  rto_style = 3

it will instead use binary output (``.bout`` and ``.bdat``\ ). And, for
completeness (though it is the default anyway), if you set ``rto_style=1``
RADMC-3D will write output in ASCII form. Note that ``rto_style = 2`` is
the old Fortran unformatted data format, which is deprecated.

For the binary form of output you can also tell RADMC-3D to use single-precision
for the main data, to produce smaller output files. This is done by adding the
following line to the ``radmc3d.inp`` file: ::

  rto_single = 1

By default RADMC-3D will always output double precision in the binary format.

*Note:* Images are still outputted in ascii even if you have ``rto_style=3``\
. This is because images are rarely files of huge size, and ascii files are
easier to analyze and check. However, sometimes images can be still quite big
(e.g.\ if you make multi-frequency images). Then it might still be useful to
output binary. If you want to also have the images in binary format, you must
set ::

  writeimage_unformatted = 1

in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file, *or* you add a keyword *imageunform*.


.. _sec-binary-io:

Binary I/O file format of RADMC-3D
==================================

The general format of the files listed in Section
:ref:`sec-unformatted-overview` is similar to the ASCII versions, just binary
this time. There is *one* additional number in the binary version: Right after
the format number comes an integer that gives the precision of the main
data. This number is either 4, meaning that the main data consists of 4-byte
floating point numbers (i.e.\ single precision), or 8, meaning that the main
data consists of 8-byte floating point numbers (i.e.\ double precision). Other
than that additional number, the order of the data is the same.

The following rules apply:

* With the exception of the ``amr_grid.binp`` file (see below),
  all integers are 8-byte integers. 

* Floating point numbers for the main data (i.e.\ the data that
  represents the space-dependent variables) are either 4-byte (single) or
  8-byte (double) precision numbers. Which of the two is specified in the
  second integer of the file (the integer right after the format number,
  see above).

* All other floating point numbers are double precision (i.e.\ 8-byte
  floats).

* For AMR-grids the ``amr_grid.binp`` file contains a huge list
  of 0 or 1 numbers (see Section :ref:`sec-amr-grid-oct-tree`). Since it is
  silly to use 8-byte integers for numbers that are either 0 or 1, the 
  numbers in this list are 1-byte integers (bytes). 


Example: According to Section :ref:`sec-dustdens` the ASCII file
``dust_density.inp`` file has the following format: ::

  iformat                                  <=== Typically 1 at present
  nrcells
  nrspec
  density[1,ispec=1]
  ..
  density[nrcells,ispec=1]
  density[1,ispec=2]
  ..
  ..
  ..
  density[nrcells,ispec=nrspec]

According to the above listed rules the binary file ``dust_density.binp`` file
then has the following format: ::

  <int8:iformat=1>
  <int8:precis=8>
  <int8:nrcells>
  <int8:nrspec>
  <dbl8:density[1,ispec=1]>
  ..
  <dbl8:density[nrcells,ispec=1]>
  <dbl8:density[1,ispec=2]>
  ..
  ..
  ..
  <dbl8:density[nrcells,ispec=nrspec]>

where the ``<int8:precis=8>`` means that this is an 8-byte integer that we call
'precis' (the name is irrelevant here), and it has value 8, and
``<dbl8:density[1,ispec=1]>`` means that this is a double-precision number
(8-byte float). In other words: the first 8 bytes of the file contain the format
number (which is 1 at present). The second 8 bytes contain the number 8, telling
that the main data (i.e.\ the ``density`` data) are double precision
variables. The third set of 8 bytes gives the number of cells, while the fourth
set gives the number of dust species. The data of ``density`` starts as of the
33rd byte of the file. If you want to compress the file even further, and you
are satisfied with single-precision data, then the file would look like: ::

  <int8:iformat=1>
  <int8:precis=4>
  <int8:nrcells>
  <int8:nrspec>
  <flt4:density[1,ispec=1]>
  ..
  <flt4:density[nrcells,ispec=1]>
  <flt4:density[1,ispec=2]>
  ..
  ..
  ..
  <flt4:density[nrcells,ispec=nrspec]>


Another example: According to Section :ref:`sec-dust-monochromatic-monte-carlo`
RADMC-3D can compute the mean intensity of radiation at each grid point at a set
of pre-defined frequencies, and write this out to an ASCII file called
``mean_intensity.out``\ . The contents of this file are: ::

  iformat                                  <=== Typically 2 at present
  nrcells
  nfreq                                    <=== Nr of frequencies 
  freq_1 freq_2 ... freq_nfreq             <=== List of frequencies in Hz
  meanint[1,icell=1]
  meanint[1,icell=2]
  ...
  meanint[1,icell=nrcells]
  meanint[2,icell=1]
  meanint[2,icell=2]
  ...
  meanint[2,icell=nrcells]
  ...
  ...
  ...
  meanint[nfreq,icell=1]
  meanint[nfreq,icell=2]
  ...
  meanint[nfreq,icell=nrcells]

By setting ``rto_style=3`` in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file, however, RADMC-3D will
instead produce a binary file called ``mean_intensity.bout``\ , which has the
contents: ::

  <int8:iformat=2>
  <int8:precis=8>
  <int8:nrcells>
  <int8:nfreq>
  <dbl8:freq_1>
  <dbl8:freq_2>
  ... 
  <dbl8:freq_nfreq>
  <dbl8:meanint[1,icell=1]>
  <dbl8:meanint[1,icell=2]>
  ...
  <dbl8:meanint[1,icell=nrcells]>
  <dbl8:meanint[2,icell=1]>
  <dbl8:meanint[2,icell=2]>
  ...
  <dbl8:meanint[2,icell=nrcells]>
  ...
  ...
  ...
  <dbl8:meanint[nfreq,icell=1]>
  <dbl8:meanint[nfreq,icell=2]>
  ...
  <dbl8:meanint[nfreq,icell=nrcells]>

If you also set ``rto_single=1`` in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file, then you
will get:
::

  <int8:iformat=2>
  <int8:precis=4>
  <int8:nrcells>
  <int8:nfreq>
  <dbl8:freq_1>
  <dbl8:freq_2>
  ... 
  <dbl8:freq_nfreq>
  <flt4:meanint[1,icell=1]>
  <flt4:meanint[1,icell=2]>
  ...
  <flt4:meanint[1,icell=nrcells]>
  <flt4:meanint[2,icell=1]>
  <flt4:meanint[2,icell=2]>
  ...
  <flt4:meanint[2,icell=nrcells]>
  ...
  ...
  ...
  <flt4:meanint[nfreq,icell=1]>
  <flt4:meanint[nfreq,icell=2]>
  ...
  <flt4:meanint[nfreq,icell=nrcells]>

Note that only the mean intensity data (the main data) are single precision
floats.



.. _sec-shearing-box:

Special binary input/output mode for embedding shearing box model into RADMC-3D
========================================================================

Many hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics models of accretion disks are
performed in the so-called shearing box approach. In this approach a small part
of the disk is modelled with periodic boundary conditions and a background
shearing motion. The advantage of this approach for the time-dependent modeling
of the dynamics of disks is that it allows much higher resolution and does not
suffer from boundary effects (other than the box size). Therefore it is still
widely in use.

To see what such a model would look like when observed with e.g.  ALMA, the box
would have to be "ported" to a 3D RADMC-3D grid. Since the local shearing box
usually does not cover all 360 degrees in azimuth, it is generally necessary to
make several copies of the box in :math:`\phi`-direction. This requires a bit of
fine-tuning, as the box must fit an integer number of times between
:math:`\phi=0` and :math:`\phi=2\pi`. This duplication (or better
:math:`n`-plicaton with :math:`n` being the number of times you copy in
:math:`\phi`-direction) produces input files that are :math:`n` times as large
as the amount of information they contain. This is an unnecessary waste of
harddisk space. It should be possible for RADMC-3D to read in the box data once,
and internally copy it :math:`n` times.

This is precisely the special input/output mode for embedding shearing box model
into RADMC-3D. It is not truly necessary, but it saves lots of disk space.

*Note:* For now this works only for ``dust_density.binp`` and
``dust_temperature.bdat``. And it only works in binary file format (``.binp`` or
``.bdat``). And, finally, it works only for spherical coordinates and for
regular, not-AMR, grids.

The trick is to set the ``iformat`` number at the beginning of the file (which
is normally set to 1) to the value 2. Then you put as data only the data of one
of the :math:`n` copies. RADMC-3D will then automatically internally make
:math:`n` copies of the data.  Then you add an additional integer right after
the precision integer, which gives the value of :math:`n`. The binary file
format looks like the following ::

  <int8:iformat=2>
  <int8:precis=8>
  <int8:ncopies>
  <int8:nrcells>
  <int8:nrspec>
  <dbl8:density[1,ispec=1]>
  ..
  <dbl8:density[nrcells/ncopies,ispec=1]>
  <dbl8:density[1,ispec=2]>
  ..
  ..
  ..
  <dbl8:density[nrcells/ncopies,ispec=nrspec]>

You can save even more disk space by going to single precision (setting ``precis=4``).

The other files all remain the same (also the grid file ``amr_grid.inp`` stays
the same and still includes all grid cells, not just those of the box).


Example: For a box of about 16 pressure scale heights in size in
:math:`\phi`-direction at 100 au around a solar type star, you typically need to
make :math:`n=5` copies of the box. If you have, say, in total 5 million cells,
then you only need to specify 1 million of them. The most compact form of
``dust_density.binp`` (single precision) would then look ::

  <int8:2>
  <int8:4>
  <int8:5>
  <int8:5000000>
  <int8:1>
  <dbl8:density[1,ispec=1]>
  ..
  <dbl8:density[1000000,ispec=1]>
