Here we create the dust opacities used in the examples/ models of RADMC-3D. The
dustkappa_silicate.inp file in many of those example models is, in fact, the
same as the dustkappa_olivine_amorph_mg50_jaeger94dorschner95.inp we will create
here. It is the opacity of amorphous olivine MgFeSiO4 with a grain radius of 0.1
micrometer.

In this directory we will also create the opacity files for amorphous pyroxene
with 70% Mg, and for amorphous carbon.

To create the opacities:

   python create_basic_opacities.py

You can plot them in Python:

   %run plot_basic_opacities.py

You can create a mixture (with a very simplistic mixing rule):

   python mix_opacities.py

You can also create different grain sizes (may take some time):

   %run create_opacities_grainsizes.py

and plot them:

   %run plot_opacities_grainsizes.py

NOTE: In version 0.41 of RADMC-3D the dustkappa_silicate.inp was extrapolated a
bit differently to wavelengths outside of the lab-measured domain. You can 
compare the new opacities (as of version 2.0 of RADMC-3D) with the old ones:

   %run plot_compare_silicate_v0.41.py

At wavelengths <0.2 micron there are differences, and there are also minor
differences >100 micron. Otherwise they are identical.

Note also that all dustkap*_v0.41.inp files are the old opacity files
from version 0.41 of RADMC-3D. They are here only for comparison.
