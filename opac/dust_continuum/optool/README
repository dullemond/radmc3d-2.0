optool is an easy-to-use opacity generating program from Carsten Dominik, based
on the opacity software from the DIANA project, by Michiel Min. You can find
optool here:

  git clone https://github.com/cdominik/optool.git

And then put this directory into your shell PATH.

To create the same kind of opacity as the bohrenhuffman_*/ directories, call
optool on the command line like this:

  optool pyr-mg70 -a 10. -s -p 0 -fmax 0 -chop 5 -radmc pyrmg70

where 10. is the grain radius in microns and 5 is the chopping angle.  This will
create the dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp file, which is the RADMC-3D opacity
file. This creates the opacity of a grain size made of pyroxene with 70% Mg (one
of the standard optical constants data sets from the Jena database), of exactly
10 micron, without averaging over particles with different size hollow cores to mimic irregular grains (-fmax 0), without porosity (-p 0), with
excessive forward scattering chopped off within an angle of 5 degrees. See
the manual of optool for more options.
