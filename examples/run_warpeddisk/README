This is the RADMC-3D version of Katherine Rosenfeld's warped disk model
(though at a lower spatial resolution):

Rosenfeld et al. "Kinematics of the CO Gas in the Inner Regions of the TW
Hya Disk". The Astrophysical Journal (2012) vol. 757 pp. 129

The model is set up mainly in the userdef_module.f90 file, i.e. it is an
internally generated model. This makes it easier to implement the AMR
oct-tree refinement. The userdef_module.f90 contains a whole suite of
subroutines, most of which are not used (they are for other purposes).
But if you look into the file you will see which subroutines are "filled"
with model-related stuff. Note that the model is set up such that the
parameters of the model can be given in two ways:

 1. The subroutine userdef_defaults() contains default values of the 
    model. If you want to tune the model, you could change these 
    values and recompile. But a more elegant way is:

 2. The subroutine userdef_parse_main_namelist() reads these parameters
    in from the radmc3d.inp file. If a parameter is NOT listed in the
    radmc3d.inp file, then the default value is used. If you put an
    entry like "userdef_r0 = 1e14" in the radmc3d.inp file, it will
    use that value instead, and it will thus override the default.

The model is that of a disk with radial Lynden-Bell & Pringle profile,
vertical Gaussian profile, and a warp. 

HOW TO START
------------
On a shell type

 python problem_setup.py

This will simply create some of the input files for RADMC-3D. 

Now compile the code locally. To do this you must edit the Makefile, 
in particular you must edit the line:

SRC = /Users/cornelisdullemond/science/prog/radmc-3d/version_2.0/src

to point to the appropriate location of the src directory. Then type

 make

This should create a local (!!) copy of radmc3d in the current directory.
It is important that from this point on you call radmc3d always as:

  ./radmc3d <<ARGUMENTS>>

(i.e. with the "./") so that it will not accidently call the globally
accessible general version of radmc3d. Your model is compiled into the
local copy.


ABOUT THE AMR-REFINEMENT
------------------------
The AMR refinement is done by the userdef_check_and_refine() subroutine.
The idea is simply that if a criterion is not met, the cell will split into
2x2x2 subcells. The current criteria that are built in are one for the
vertical resolution and one for the radial resolution. If either of the two
criteria is not met, the cell is split. You can edit this subroutine if you
want a different kind of criterion (e.g. one based on the density). You
are completely free to do this in the way you want.

The way RADMC-3D does the AMR refinement is tricky in one respect: You must
make an estimate of how many cells and branches you will need for your
AMR-refined model. This is because, before the start of the refinement,
RADMC-3D already needs memory allocated for various quantities such as
density etc. So it needs to do an allocation of arrays before it even starts
the refinement process. You will have to tell RADMC-3D how many cells it has
to reserve. If the refinement process then runs out of cells, it will stop
and give you a notification that you will have to increase that
estimate. The AMR stuff is initialized in the userdef_prep_model()
subroutine. The estimate is done in the lines:

  nbase  = userdef_nx*userdef_ny*userdef_nz  ! Nr of base grid cells
  nlftot = nbase * userdef_nrefinefact       ! Estimated max nr of leafs
  nbrtot = nlftot + nlftot / 6               ! Estimated max nr of branches

You can set userdef_nrefinefact to a higher value if you need it. When
RADMC-3D runs you get a status report of the AMR memory usage:

 Grid information (current status):
   We have 126472 branches, of which 110788 are actual grid cells.
   ---> 36.135% mem use for branches, and 36.929% mem use for actual cells.
   Top refinement level of the grid = 9

In this example you see that you have more memory allocated that strictly
needed (only 36% used). As long as your computer has sufficient memory that
is fine. If you are low on memory you could lower userdef_nrefinefact if you
wish.


USING SUBBOX TO VIEW THE GRID AND THE MODEL
-------------------------------------------
Because it is not entirely easy to visualize AMR data, especially if they
are generated from within the RADMC-3D code itself, RADMC-3D has a special
method called "subbox". It allows you to create a regularly spaced data
cube from the AMR-based data. This is illustrated in the following three
python scripts:

   plot_subbox.py
   plot_subbox_volrender.py
   plot_subplane.py


USING PARAVIEW TO VIEW THE GRID AND THE MODEL
---------------------------------------------
Note that you may want to carefully play with the AMR refinement, to 
be sure that it is fine enough for your purpose. One way to visualize
the grid is to call:

  ./radmc3d vtk_grid

and open the model.vtk with paraview (http://www.paraview.org/). You
can also view the density distribution:

  ./radmc3d vtk_dust_density 1

The "1" stands for "dust species 1".
