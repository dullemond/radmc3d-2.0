This is a very simple 0-D (one-zone) model of a box of molecular gas.
The lines we study are those of CO. We use the LTE assumption, using
lines_mode=1. The populations are stored for all levels (no level
subset is chosen). The molecular data file molecule_co.inp is a direct
copy of the co.dat file of the LAMDA database from Leiden. 

Check out the problem_setup.py. The setup can be trivially extended to
3-D. The dust temperature is not calculated; it is simply set to 30 K.

As usual, make the setup in Python with:

  python problem_setup.py
  radmc3d calcpop

A file levelpop_co.dat is produced, containing the absolute populations
(i.e. in units of 1/cm^3) of all levels of the molecule_co.inp file. By
typing

  radmc3d spectrum iline 1 widthkms 1

a spectrum is produced (spectrum.out). The width of the window around the
line center is taken to be 1 km/s. You can inspect the spectrum (which is
located in the file spectrum.out) using the Python routines analyze.py
from radmc3dPy. So go into iPython and type:

  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  from radmc3dPy.analyze import *
  s=readSpectrum()
  plt.plot(s[:,0],s[:,1])

which plots the spectrum of the line. If you wish to make use of the
more fancy spectrum plotting tools of radmc3dPy, try out:

  plotSpectrum(s,dpc=140)

where dpc sets the source at a distance of 140 parsec.

Typically, however, you want lines to be plotted with the x-axis
in km/s. For that you have to know which line you are looking at,
i.e., which rest wavelength it has. You can read the molecule_co.inp
file for the carbon monoxide molecule, and then call plotSpectrum()
in the following way:

  mol=readMol('co')
  plotSpectrum(s,mol=mol,ilin=1,dpc=140.)

Have a look at the documentation of plotSpectrum to see all its options:

  ?plotSpectrum

You can also try out the problem_plotexamples.py:

  %run problem_plotexamples
