---> As run_simple_1_userdef/, but now with grid refinement

This is an example of how to make a model internally inside radmc3d and how
to use grid refinement while setting up the model. It also demonstrates the
useage of the userdef_module.f90 module and the special-purpose compilation
of radmc3d.

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README                         (This file)
  Makefile                       (The local Makefile for the local build)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.py               (a Python script for setting up some input files)
  userdef_module.f90             (the place where the model and grid are set up)

This is what the model does:

  The model sets up a simple Gaussian blob of dust surrounding a star in a
  3-D cartesian grid. The model is set up in the userdef_module.f90 module,
  i.e. inside the radmc3d code. This obviates the need of creating the
  dust_density.inp and amr_grid.inp files. But some other files are still
  created by the problem_setup.py script. The model setup makes use of
  the oct-tree grid refinement capabilities of radmc3d.

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Edit the Makefile in this directory and make sure that the compiler
     settings are alright. Also set the SRC variable to the correct 
     path of the source directory of radmc3d.
  2) Inside this model directory type 'make'. This will create a local
     executable radmc3d.
  3) Type 'python problem_setup.py'

You can now already make images, because here the temperature of the 
dust is already set by the setup. Whether that temperature is correct
is another story; it's just parameterized. Better you calculate the
temperatures properly with

  ./radmc3d mctherm

Now plot stuff:

  ipython --matplotlib
  %run problem_plotexamples.py

Please read the run_simple_1/README file for further information

Tip: you can see the refinement of the grid in the images if you make the
image at incl=phi=0 and if you set the tnoise in the problem_setup.py to
10.e0 or so. 

A note about the AMR: Since this setup does on-the-fly refinement, we do
not know in advance how many cells we will need. However, for data memory
management reasons we MUST specify some reasonable maximum number of cells
that we expect. This is, unfortunately, not easy to predict, because it
depends entirely on the scheme of AMR refinement implemented in the
userdef_module.f90 module. The factor userdef_nrefinefact is meant to
allow the user to specify how much larger (i.e. by which factor) the
number of grid cells he/she expects to be needed, compared to the unrefined
grid. If you run radmc3d and get a message that you run out of free cells,
then enlarging this parameter will fix that. Making it too large, on the
other hand, may require too much memory space. 

See run_simple_1/README for more details.

VIEWING THE AMR GRID WITH PARAVIEW:
-----------------------------------
You can produce vtk files that can be viewed by Paraview, a publicly available
3-D viewing tool. This will allow you to get a better feeling for the complex
AMR gridding. Example, type:

  ./radmc3d vtk_grid

will produce a file called model.vtk which you can read with Paraview.
Choose, in Paraview, the wireframe view, and you can see the structure of
the 3-D AMR grid. You can also view the data itself, e.g.

  ./radmc3d vtk_dust_density 1

See the new dedicated chapter about VTK files in the manual.
