---> As run_simple_1, but set up using userdef_module.f90

This is an example of how to make a model internally inside radmc3d. It also
demonstrates the useage of the userdef_module.f90 module and the
special-purpose compilation of radmc3d.

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README                         (This file)
  Makefile                       (The local Makefile for the local build)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.py               (a Python script for setting up some input files)
  userdef_module.f90             (the place where the model and grid are set up)

This is what the model does:

  The model sets up a simple Gaussian blob of dust surrounding a star in a
  3-D cartesian grid. The model is set up in the userdef_module.f90 module,
  i.e. inside the radmc3d code. This obviates the need of creating the
  dust_density.inp and amr_grid.inp files. But some other files are still
  created by the problem_setup.py script. 

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Edit the Makefile in this directory and make sure that the compiler
     settings are alright. Also set the SRC variable to the correct 
     path of the source directory of radmc3d.
  2) Inside this model directory type 'make'. This will create a local
     executable radmc3d.
  3) Type 'python problem_setup.py'
  4) Type './radmc3d mctherm' and wait until this is finished
  6) Now you can use the radmc3dPy libraries to plot things in Python.
     See run_simple_1/ for further details.
