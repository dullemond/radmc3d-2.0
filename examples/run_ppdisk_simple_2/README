This is the same model as run_ppdisk_simple_1, but now with two dust species:
one small grain species and a midplane layer of large grains. The mass of the
disk is increased compared to run_ppdisk_simple_1.

The "fracbig" variable sets the ratio of how much of the dust mass is in the big
grains.

The two grain opacities can be created using using problem_makeopac.py, which is
using the routines from ../../opac/dust_continuum/bohrenhuffman_python/ which
are copied here for convenience. Also it uses the optical constants file
pyrmg70.lnk, which is from the Jena database of optical constants:

http://www.astro.uni-jena.de/Laboratory/Database/databases.html

But see ../../opac/dust_continuum/bohrenhuffman_python/ for more details
on how to make opacities for RADMC-3D. 

How to run:

  python problem_setup.py
  radmc3d mctherm setthreads 4

and then in Python:

  %run problem_plotexamples.py
