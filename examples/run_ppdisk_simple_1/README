This is a very simple model setup for a protoplanetary disk. It demonstrates
how one could set up a disk model. BUT: It is very primitive! For production
run models you must be careful for:

 (1) adjust the thetaup to ensure that all the material of your model is
     covered by the grid
 (2) maybe adjust the theta spacing near the midplane (RADMC-3D allows you
     to use variable grid spacing, so you could have a finer-spaced theta
     grid near the midplane if, for instance, your model has dust settling
     included)
 (3) Refine the grid near the inner rim of the disk. The inner rim tends to
     produce a strong NIR flux, because it is directly illuminated by the
     star at a perpendicular angle. However, if you under-resolve the radial
     grid at the inner edge, you will under-predict the NIR flux, because
     your inner grid cells become too cold (still much hotter than the rest
     of the disk, but too cold anyway). The inner rim must be smoothly
     sampled from tau<<1 via tau=~ 1 to tau>>1, where tau is the radial
     optical depth from the star into the disk, the the dust opacity
     at stellar wavelength. Often a degree of smoothing of the density
     may be necessary, because refinement in radial grid may become too
     fine.
